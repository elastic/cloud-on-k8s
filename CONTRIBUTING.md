## Report your bugs

If you find an issue, check first our [list of issues](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues). If your problem has not been reported yet, open a new issue, add a detailed description on how to reproduce the problem and complete it with any additional information that might help solving the issue.

## Set up your development environment

Check requirements and steps in this [guide](dev-setup.md).

## Contribute with your code

### Format your code and manage imports

1. Run `make lint` to make sure there are no lint warnings.
2. Make sure you only have, at maximum, 3 groups in your imports:
   - a group for packages from the standard library
   - (optionally) a group for third parties
   - (optionally) a group for 'local' imports (local being 'github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s')

### Scripts

As most of the contributors are using macOS and Linux, make sure that scripts run on these two environments.

### Tests

Your contributions should pass the existing tests. You must provide new tests to demonstrate bugs and fixes.

#### Test suites

There are 4 test suites:

- **Unit tests** - use standard `go test` and [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) assertions. Keep them small, fast and reliable.

  A good practice is to have some [table-driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests), you can use [gotests](https://github.com/cweill/gotests) to quickly generate them from your code.

- **Integration tests** - some tests are flagged as integration as they can take more than a few milliseconds to complete. It's usually recommended to separate them from the rest of the unit tests that run fast. Usually they include disk I/O operations, network I/O operations on a test port, or encryption computations. We also rely on the kubebuilder testing framework, that spins up etcd and the apiserver locally, and enqueues requests to a reconciliation function.

- **End-to-end tests** - (e2e) allow us to test interactions between the operator and a real Kubernetes cluster.
  They use the standard `go test` tooling. See the `test/e2e` directory. We recommend to rely primarily on unit and integration tests, as e2e tests are slow and hard to debug because they simulate real user scenarios. To run a specific e2e test, you can use something similar to `make TESTS_MATCH=TestMetricbeatStackMonitoringRecipe clean docker-build docker-push e2e-docker-build e2e-docker-push e2e-run`. This will run the e2e test with your latest commit and is very close to how it will run in CI.

  A faster option is to run the operator and tests locally, with `make run` in one shell and `make e2e-local TESTS_MATCH= TestMetricbeatStackMonitoringRecipe` in another, though this does not exercise all of the same configuration (permissions etc.) that will be used in CI, so is not as thorough.

- **Helm chart tests** - allows us to test helm charts. To run helm chart tests, you can use `make helm-test` command.

#### Pull Request validation

For security reasons, an Elastic engineer will trigger continuous integration to run these tests and report any failures in the pull request.

All tests must pass to validate a pull request.

### Logging

The operator relies on controller-runtime logging instead of golang built-in log library. It uses a type of logging called _structured logging_, log messages must not contain variables, but they can be associated with some key/value pairs.

For example, do not write:

```golang
log.Printf("starting reconciliation for pod %s/%s", podNamespace, podName)
```

But instead write:

```golang
logger.Info("starting reconciliation", "pod", req.NamespacedNamed)
```

We only use two levels: `debug` and `info`. To produce a log at the `debug` level use `V(1)` before the `Info` call:

```golang
logger.V(1).Info("starting reconciliation", "pod", req.NamespacedNamed)
```

### License headers

We require license headers on all files that are part of the source code.

### Submit your changes

#### Sign the CLA

Make sure you signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.elastic.co/fr/contributor-agreement/). You only need to sign the CLA once. By signing this agreement, you give us the right to distribute your code without restriction.

#### Prepare a Pull Request

Here are some good practices for a good pull request:

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Break your pull request into smaller PRs if it's too large.
- Run and pass unit and integration tests with `make unit` and `make integration`.
- Write a short and self-explanatory title.
- Write a clear description to make the code reviewer understand what the PR is about.

### Backports

New PRs should target the `main` branch, then be backported as necessary. The original PR to main should contain labels of the versions it will be backported to. The actual backport PR should be labeled `backport`. You can use https://github.com/sqren/backport to generate backport PRs easily. An example `.backportrc.json` may be:

```json
{
  "upstream": "elastic/cloud-on-k8s",
  "targetBranchChoices": [{ "name": "1.2", "checked": true }, "1.1", "1.0"],
  "targetPRLabels": ["backport"]
}
```

## Contribute to ECK documentation

Whether itâ€™s a new or existing feature, make sure you document it.
Before you start, pull the latest files from these repos:

- [elastic/cloud-on-k8s](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s): Contains the docs source files for Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes.
- [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs): Has the tools to publish locally your changes before committing them.

To update existing content, find the right file in the [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs) repo and make your change.

To create new content in a new file, add the file to [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs), and include it in the [index.asciidoc](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/blob/main/docs/index.asciidoc).

NOTE: For searchability purposes, the file name should match the first top-level section ID of the document. For example:

- File name: `apm-server.asciidoc`
- Section ID: `[id="{p}-apm-server"]`

Test the doc build locally:

1. Move to the directory where the [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs) repository has been pulled
1. Run the following command:

   `./build_docs --asciidoctor --doc $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/docs/index.asciidoc --chunk 1 --open`

Push a PR for review and add the label `>docs`.

## Design documents

We keep track of architectural decisions through the [architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/). All records must apply the [Markdown Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format. We recommend to read [these documents](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs/design) to understand the technical choices that we make.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
