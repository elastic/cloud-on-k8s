## Report your bugs

If you find an issue, check first our [list of issues](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues). If your problem has not been reported yet, open a new issue, add a detailed description on how to reproduce the problem and complete it with any additional information that might help solving the issue.

## Set up your development environment

Check requirements and steps in this [guide](dev-setup.md).

## Contribute with your code

### Format your code and manage imports

1. Run `make lint` to make sure there are no lint warnings.
2. Make sure you only have two groups in your imports:
    - a group for packages from the standard library
    - a group for third parties

### Scripts

As most of the contributors are using macOS and Linux, make sure that scripts run on these two environments.

### Tests

Your contributions should pass the existing tests. You must provide new tests to demonstrate bugs and fixes.

#### Test suites

There are 3 test suites:

- **Unit tests** - use standard `go test` and [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) assertions. Keep them small, fast and reliable.
  
  A good practice is to have some [table-driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests), you can use [gotests](https://github.com/cweill/gotests) to quickly generate them from your code.
  
- **Integration tests** - some tests are flagged as integration as they can take more than a few milliseconds to complete. It's usually recommended to separate them from the rest of the unit tests that run fast. Usually they include disk I/O operations, network I/O operations on a test port, or encryption computations. We also rely on the kubebuilder testing framework, that spins up etcd and the apiserver locally, and enqueues requests to a reconciliation function.

- **End-to-end tests** - (e2e) allow us to test interactions between the operator and a real Kubernetes cluster.
      They use the standard `go test` tooling. See the `test/e2e` directory. We recommend to rely primarily on unit and integration tests, as e2e tests are slow and hard to debug because they simulate real user scenarios.

### Logging

The operator relies on controller-runtime logging instead of golang built-in log library. It uses a type of logging called _structured logging_, log messages must not contain variables, but they can be associated with some key/value pairs.

For example, do not write:

```golang
log.Printf("starting reconciliation for pod %s/%s", podNamespace, podName)
```

But instead write:

```golang
logger.Info("starting reconciliation", "pod", req.NamespacedNamed)
```

We only use two levels: `debug` and `info`. To produce a log at the `debug` level use `V(1)` before the `Info` call:

```golang
logger.V(1).Info("starting reconciliation", "pod", req.NamespacedNamed)
```

### License headers

We require license headers on all files that are part of the source code.

### Submit your changes

#### Sign the CLA

Make sure you signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.elastic.co/fr/contributor-agreement/). You only need to sign the CLA once. By signing this agreement, you give us the right to distribute your code without restriction.

#### Prepare a Pull Request

Here are some good practices for a good pull request:

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Break your pull request into smaller PRs if it's too large.
- Run and pass unit and integration tests with `make unit` and `make integration`.
- Write a short and self-explanatory title.
- Write a clear description to make the code reviewer understand what the PR is about.

## Contribute to ECK documentation

Whether itâ€™s a new or existing feature, make sure you document it.
Before you start, pull the latest files from these repos:
* [elastic/cloud-on-k8s](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s): Contains the docs source files for Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes.
* [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs): Has the tools to publish locally your changes before committing them.

To update existing content, find the right file in the [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/master/docs) repo and make your change.

To create new content in a new file, add the file to [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/master/docs), and include it in the [index.asciidoc](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/blob/master/docs/index.asciidoc).

NOTE: For searchability purposes, the file name should match the first top-level section ID of the document. For example:
 * File name: `apm-server.asciidoc`
 * Section ID: `[id="{p}-apm-server"]`

Test the doc build locally:

1. Move to the directory where the [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs) repository has been pulled
1. Run the following command:

   `./build_docs --asciidoctor --doc $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/docs/index.asciidoc --chunk 1 --open`
   
Push a PR for review and add the label `>docs`.


## Design documents

We keep track of architectural decisions through the [architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/). All records must apply the [Markdown Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format. We recommend to read [these documents](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/master/docs/design) to understand the technical choices that we make.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
