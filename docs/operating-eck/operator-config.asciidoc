ECK can be configured using either command line flags or environment variables.

|Flag |Default|Description
|auto-port-forward |false |Enables automatic port forwarding to allow running the operator outside the cluster. For dev use only as it exposes k8s resources on ephemeral ports to localhost.
|ca-cert-rotate-before |24h |Duration representing how long before expiration CA certificates should be re-issued.
|ca-cert-validity |8760h |Duration representing the validity period of a generated CA certificate.
|cert-rotate-before |24h |Duration representing how long before expiration TLS certificates should be re-issued.
|cert-validity |8760h |Duration representing the validity period of a generated TLS certificate.
|container-registry |docker.elastic.co | Container registry to use for pulling Elastic Stack container images.
|debug-http-listen |localhost:6060 |Listen address for the debug HTTP server. Only available in development mode.
|development |false |Enable developmenet mode. Only available as a CLI flag.
|enable-tracing | false | Enable APM tracing in the operator process. APM server URL, credentials etc. can be configured via environment variables. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/go/1.x/configuration.html[Apm Go Agent reference] for details.
|enable-webhook | false | Enables a validating webhook server in the operator process.
|enforce-rbac-on-refs| false | Enables restrictions on cross-namespace resource association through RBAC
|log-verbosity |0 |Verbosity level of logs. `-2`=Error, `-1`=Warn, `0`=Info, `0` and above=Debug
|manage-webhook-certs |true |Enables automatic webhook certificate management.
|max-concurrent-reconciles |3 | Maximum number of concurrent reconciles per controller (Elasticsearch, Kibana, APM Server). Affects the ability of the operator to process changes concurrently.
|metrics-port |0 |Prometheus metrics port. Set to 0 to disable the metrics endpoint.
|namespaces |"" |Namespaces in which this operator should manage resources. Accepts multiple comma-separated values. Defaults to all namespaces if empty or unspecified.
|operator-namespace |"" |Namespace the operator runs in. Required.
|webhook-pods-label |"" |Label used to select pods running the webhook server.
|webhook-secret |"" | K8s secret mounted into the path designated by webhook-cert-dir to be used for webhook certificates.

Unless noted otherwise, environment variables can be used instead of flags to configure the operator as well. Simply convert the flag name to upper case and replace any dashes (`-`) with underscores (`_`). For example, the `log-verbosity` flag can be set by an environment variable named `LOG_VERBOSITY`.

Duration values should be specified as numeric values suffixed by the time unit. For example, a duration of 10 hours should be specified as `10h`. Acceptable time unit suffixes are:

|Suffix |Unit
|ms | Milliseconds
|s  | Seconds
|m  | Minutes
|h  | Hours

Edit the `elastic-operator` StatefulSet to change any of the flag values. <<{p}-eck-debug-logs>> illustrates how to change the log level of the operator using this method.
