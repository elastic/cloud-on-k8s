= Configure ECK

ECK can be configured using either command line flags or environment variables.


[width="100%",cols=".^35m,.^25m,.^40d",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Default|Description
|ca-cert-rotate-before |24h |Duration representing how long before expiration CA certificates should be re-issued.
|ca-cert-validity |8760h |Duration representing the validity period of a generated CA certificate.
|ca-dir |"" |Path to a directory containing a CA certificate (tls.crt) and its associated private key (tls.key) to be used for all managed resources. Effectively disables the CA rotation and validity options.
|cert-rotate-before |24h |Duration representing how long before expiration TLS certificates should be re-issued.
|cert-validity |8760h |Duration representing the validity period of a generated TLS certificate.
|config |"" | Path to a file containing the operator configuration.
|container-registry |docker.elastic.co | Container registry to use for pulling Elastic Stack container images.
|container-repository |"" | Container repository to use for pulling Elastic Stack container images.
|container-suffix |"" | Suffix to be appended to container images by default. Cannot be combined with `--ubi-only` flag.
|disable-config-watch| false| Watch the configuration file for changes and restart to apply them. Only effective when the `--config` flag is used to set the configuration file.
|disable-telemetry| false| Disable periodically updating ECK telemetry data for Kibana to consume.
|elasticsearch-client-timeout| 180s| Default timeout for requests made by the Elasticsearch client.
|enable-leader-election | true | Enable leader election. Must be set to true if using multiple replicas of the operator
|enable-tracing | false | Enable APM tracing in the operator process. Use environment variables to configure APM server URL, credentials, and so on. Check link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/go/1.x/configuration.html[Apm Go Agent reference] for details.
|enable-webhook | false | Enables a validating webhook server in the operator process.
|enforce-rbac-on-refs| false | Enables restrictions on cross-namespace resource association through RBAC.
|exposed-node-labels|""| List of Kubernetes node labels which are allowed to be copied as annotations on the Elasticsearch Pods. Check <<{p}-availability-zone-awareness>> for more details.
|ip-family|""| Set the IP family to use. Possible values: IPv4, IPv6, "" (= auto-detect)
|kube-client-qps|0| Set the maximum number of queries per second to the Kubernetes API. Default value is inherited from the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/e6538dd42b4fe55b6c754e41c66b43133ba41a59/rest/config.go#L44[Go client].
|kube-client-timeout|60s| Set the request timeout for Kubernetes API calls made by the operator.
|log-verbosity |0 |Verbosity level of logs. `-2`=Error, `-1`=Warn, `0`=Info, `0` and above=Debug.
|manage-webhook-certs |true |Enables automatic webhook certificate management.
|max-concurrent-reconciles |3 | Maximum number of concurrent reconciles per controller (Elasticsearch, Kibana, APM Server). Affects the ability of the operator to process changes concurrently.
|metrics-port |0 |Prometheus metrics port. Set to 0 to disable the metrics endpoint.
|namespaces |"" |Namespaces in which this operator should manage resources. Accepts multiple comma-separated values. Defaults to all namespaces if empty or unspecified.
|operator-namespace |"" |Namespace the operator runs in. Required.
|password-hash-cache-size|5 x max-concurrent-reconciles|Sets the size of the password hash cache. Caching is disabled if explicitly set to 0 or any negative value.
|set-default-security-context | auto-detect | Enables adding a default Pod Security Context to Elasticsearch Pods in Elasticsearch `8.0.0` and later. `fsGroup` is set to `1000` by default to match Elasticsearch container default UID. This behavior might not be appropriate for OpenShift and PSP-secured Kubernetes clusters, so it can be disabled.
|ubi-only | false | Use only UBI container images to deploy Elastic Stack applications. UBI images are only available from 7.10.0 onward. Cannot be combined with `--container-suffix` flag.
|validate-storage-class | true | Specifies whether the operator should retrieve storage classes to verify volume expansion support. Can be disabled if cluster-wide storage class RBAC access is not available.
|webhook-cert-dir |"{TempDir}/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs" |Path to the directory that contains the webhook server key and certificate.
|webhook-name |"elastic-webhook.k8s.elastic.co" |Name of the Kubernetes ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource. Only used when `enable-webhook` is true.
|webhook-secret |"" | K8s secret mounted into the path designated by webhook-cert-dir to be used for webhook certificates.
|webhook-port   | 9443    | Port to listen for incoming validation requests.
|===


Unless noted otherwise, environment variables can be used instead of flags to configure the operator as well. Simply convert the flag name to upper case and replace any dashes (`-`) with underscores (`_`). For example, the `log-verbosity` flag can be set by an environment variable named `LOG_VERBOSITY`.

Duration values should be specified as numeric values suffixed by the time unit. For example, a duration of 10 hours should be specified as `10h`. Acceptable time unit suffixes are:

[width="50%",cols="25m,75d",options="header"]
|===
|Suffix |Unit
|ms | Milliseconds
|s  | Seconds
|m  | Minutes
|h  | Hours
|===


If you have a large number of configuration options to specify, use the `--config` flag to point to a file containing those options. For example, assume you have a file named `eck-config.yaml` with the following content:

.eck-config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
log-verbosity: 2
metrics-port: 6060
namespaces: [ns1, ns2, ns3]
----

The operator can be started using any of the following methods to achieve the same end result:

.Configuration file method
[source,sh]
----
./elastic-operator manager --config=eck-config.yaml
----

.Command-line flags method
[source,sh]
----
./elastic-operator manager --log-verbosity=2 --metrics-port=6060 --namespaces=ns1,ns2,ns3
----

.Environment variables method
[source,sh]
----
LOG_VERBOSITY=2 METRICS_PORT=6060 NAMESPACES="ns1,ns2,ns3" ./elastic-operator manager
----

If you use a combination of all or some of the these methods, the descending order of precedence in case of a conflict is as follows:

- Flag
- Environment variable
- File


You can edit the `elastic-operator` ConfigMap to change the operator configuration. Unless the `--disable-config-watch` flag is set, the operator should restart automatically to apply the new changes. Alternatively, you can edit the `elastic-operator` StatefulSet and add flags to the `args` section -- which will trigger an automatic restart of the operator pod by the StatefulSet controller.

== Configure ECK under Operator Lifecycle Manager

If you use link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] to install and run ECK, follow these steps to configure the operator:

- Create a new ConfigMap in the same namespace as the operator. It should contain a key named `eck.yaml` pointing to the desired configuration values.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: elastic-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
data:
  eck.yaml: |-
    log-verbosity: 0
    metrics-port: 6060 
    container-registry: docker.elastic.co
    max-concurrent-reconciles: 3
    ca-cert-validity: 8760h
    ca-cert-rotate-before: 24h
    cert-validity: 8760h
    cert-rotate-before: 24h
----

- Update your link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/subscription-config.md[Subscription] to mount the ConfigMap under `/conf`.
