= Required RBAC permissions

Installing and running ECK, as well as using ECK-managed resources requires certain Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac[permissions]. These permissions are listed below, with a reason why they are needed.


[float]
[id="{p}-{page_id}-installing-crds"]
== Installing CRDs

This permission is required to install CRDs. CRDs (link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[CustomResourceDefinitions]) are the only non-namespaced resources required to be installed.

[id="{p}-{page_id}-installing-operator"]
== Installing the ECK operator

These permissions are required to install the ECK operator in a Kubernetes cluster.

[width="100%",cols=".^1m,.^1m,.^1d,.^97",options="header"]
|===
|Name|API group|Optional?|Usage
|StatefulSet or Deployment|apps|no|The ECK operator can be either deployed as a StatefulSet or as a Deployment.
|ServiceAccount|core|no|Service account that the operator Pods run as.
|Role or ClusterRole|rbac.authorization.k8s.io|no|Role bound to the operators Service account. Depending on the installation type (global/restricted) either a global (ClusterRole) or a namespaced (Role) resource is needed.
|RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding|rbac.authorization.k8s.io|no|Binding between the operators role and the operators service account. Depending on the installation type (global/restricted), either global (ClusterRoleBinding) or namespaced (RoleBinding) resource is needed.
|ConfigMap|core|yes|Configuration parameters of the Operator. They can be specified directly in the StatefulSet (or Deployment) resource instead.
|Namespace|core|yes|Namespace where the operator will run. It can be a pre-existing namespace as well.
|ValidatingWebhookConfiguration|admissionregistration.k8s.io|yes|Validating webhook installation. It provides fast feedback for the user directly as a APIServer response. A subset of these validations is also run by the operator itself, but the results are only available through operator logs and Kubernetes events. Check link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-webhook.html[docs] for more.
|Secret|core|yes|Secret containing the validating webhook's endpoint CA certificate.
|Service|core|yes|Service for validating webhook endpoint.
