== Uninstall ECK

Before you uninstall the operator, you must to uninstall the Elastic resources that it has created:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete elastic --all --all-namesapces
----

This should delete all underlying Elasticsearch, Kibana or APM Server resources (pods, secrets, services, etc.).

Then you can uninstall the operator itself:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/0.9.0/all-in-one.yaml
----

And terminate with the webhook configuration:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations validating-webhook-configuration
----
