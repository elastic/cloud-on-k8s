:role_mappings_warning: We have identified an issue with Elasticsearch 8.15 that prevents security role mappings configured via Stack configuration policies to work correctly. The only workaround is to specify the security role mappings via the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-put-role-mapping.html[Elasticsearch REST API]. After an upgrade from a previous Elasticsearch version to 8.15 role mappings will be preserved but will not receive future updates from the Stack configuration policy. We are working on a fix to restore the functionality in a future Elasticsearch release.
