:role_mappings_warning: We have identified an issue with Elasticsearch 8.15.1 and 8.15.2 that prevents security role mappings configured via Stack configuration policies to work correctly. The only workaround is to specify the security role mappings via the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-put-role-mapping.html[Elasticsearch REST API]. After upgrading to these versions role mappings will be preserved but will not receive future updates from the Stack configuration policy. Follow the instructions to <<{p}-common-problems-815-reconfigure-role-mappings, reconfigure role mappings after upgrading to 8.15.3>>.
