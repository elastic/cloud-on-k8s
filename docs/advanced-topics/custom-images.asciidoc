= Create custom images

You can create your own custom Elasticsearch or Kibana image instead of using the base image provided by Elastic. You might want to do this to preload plugins in the image rather than having to link:k8s-init-containers-plugin-downloads.html[install them via init container] each time a pod starts. To do this, you must use the official image as the base for it to function properly. For example, if you want to create an Elasticsearch {version} image with the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/master/repository-gcs.html[Google Cloud Storage Repository Plugin], you can do the following:

. Create a `Dockerfile` containing:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:{version}
RUN bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch repository-gcs
----

. Build the image with:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
docker build --tag elasticsearch-gcs:{version}
----

There are various hosting options for your images. If you use Google Kubernetes Engine, it is automatically configured to use the Google Container Registry (see https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/using-with-google-cloud-platform#google-kubernetes-engine[here] for more information). To use the image, you can then https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling#pushing_an_image_to_a_registry[push to the registry] with:

[subs="attributes"]
----
docker tag elasticsearch-gcs:{version} gcr.io/$PROJECT-ID/elasticsearch-gcs:{version}
docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT-ID/elasticsearch-gcs:{version}
----


Configure your Elasticsearch specification to use the newly pushed image, for example:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
spec:
  version: {version}
  image: gcr.io/$PROJECT-ID/elasticsearch-gcs:{version}
----

NOTE: Providing the correct version is always required as ECK reasons about APIs and capabilities available to it based on the version field.

The steps are similar for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr[Azure Kubernetes Service] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-basics.html#use-ecr[AWS Elastic Container Registry].

[id="{p}-container-registry-override"]
== Override the default container registry

When creating Elasticsearch, Kibana, or APM Server resources, the operator defaults to using container images pulled from the `docker.elastic.co` registry. If you are in an environment where external network access is restricted, you could configure the operator to use a different default container registry by starting the operator with the `--container-registry` command-line flag. (See <<{p}-operator-config>> for more information about how to configure the operator using command-line flags and environment variables).

The operator expects container images to be located at specific paths in the default container registry. Make sure that your container images are stored at the right path and are tagged correctly with the stack version number. For example, if your private registry is `my.registry` and you wish to deploy components from stack version {version}, the following image paths should exist:


* +my.registry/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:{version}+
* +my.registry/kibana/kibana:{version}+
* +my.registry/apm/apm-server:{version}+
