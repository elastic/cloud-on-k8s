=== Bug fix

This release fixes a compatibility issue introduced in ECK 1.7.0 with some versions of Kubernetes. Once ECK 1.7.0 is installed, subsequent `kubectl` commands may fail with the following message:

[source,bash]
----
error: SchemaError(co.elastic.k8s.elasticsearch.v1.Elasticsearch.spec.nodeSets.volumeClaimTemplates): array should have exactly one sub-item
----

If you are experiencing this issue you must first patch the Elasticsearch CRD with the following command before upgrading to a more recent version of ECK:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl patch crd elasticsearches.elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co --type json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/versions/0/schema/openAPIV3Schema/properties/spec/properties/nodeSets/items/properties/volumeClaimTemplates/x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields"}]'
----
