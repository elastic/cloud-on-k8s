=== Wolfi images

ECK has transitioned to using https://github.com/wolfi-dev[Wolfi images], an open-source project aimed at delivering a secure, minimal base image for containerized applications. By adopting Wolfi, ECK strengthens its security posture, significantly lowering the potential for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and reducing the overall attack surface. This shift aligns with best practices for container security, providing a more robust foundation for running workloads reliably and securely.
