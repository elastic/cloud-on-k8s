=== ECK Enterprise Search Helm chart

ECK 2.13.0 supports managing Enterprise search resources via Helm charts, similarly to other components of the Elastic stack
(see https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/deploy/eck-stack/charts/eck-enterprise-search/examples[examples]).

[id="{p}-2130-allow-disabling-elastic-user"]
=== Allow disabling the elastic user

ECK 2.13.0 introduces a new option that allows a user to disable the elastic user from being created upon Elasticsearch creation. A use case for this would be when an organization/user would prefer to manage all users/roles via SSO (SAML/IDP/LDAP/etc)
(see https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/blob/main/docs/orchestrating-elastic-stack-applications/security/users-and-roles.asciidoc#disabling-the-default-elastic-user[documentation]).
