=== Known issues
- Upgrading Kibana configured with <<{p}-kibana-secure-settings,secure settings>> to version `8.11.2` leads to Kibana pods being unavailable with status `Init:Error`.
The underlying link:https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues/6303[issue] shows a workaround if you are in this situation.
Upgrade directly to `8.11.3` to avoid this.
