==== Pod suspension for Elasticsearch troubleshooting

Some debugging operations, like using the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/node-tool.html[elasticsearch-node] tool, require access to the Pod before the Elasticsearch process starts. Starting with ECK `1.9.0`, this functionality is provided by the operator.

=== Known issues

- On Openshift versions 4.6 and below, when installing or upgrading to 1.9.[0,1], the operator will be stuck in a state of `Installing` within the Openshift UI, and found in a `CrashLoopBackoff` within Kubernetes because of Webhook certificate location mismatches. More information and work-around can be found in link:https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues/5191[this issue].
- When using the `elasticsearchRef` mechanism with Elastic Agent in version 7.17 and later its Pods will enter a `CrashLoopBackoff`. The issue will be fixed in ECK 2.0 for Elasticsearch versions 8.0 and later. A workaround is described in link:https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues/5323#issuecomment-1028954034[this issue].
