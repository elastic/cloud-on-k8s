=== Logstash support for persistent volumes

ECK 2.9.0 includes a technical preview for persistent volumes for link:https://www.elastic.co/logstash/[Logstash] resources. A default data volume is now created for each Logstash and additional volumes can be defined for example for Logstash's persistent queue feature. This is a breaking change from  version 2.8.0 of the ECK operator and requires re-creation of existing Logstash objects.

Refer to the <<{p}-logstash-volumes>> for more information.
