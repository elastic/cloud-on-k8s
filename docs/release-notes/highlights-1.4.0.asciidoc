A single Elastic Agent deployment can be used to replace multiple Beats deployments that were previously necessary to collect the different types of data you want to monitor. ECK 1.4.0 introduces experimental support for Elastic Agent in link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/run-elastic-agent-standalone.html[standalone mode] as a technology preview.
