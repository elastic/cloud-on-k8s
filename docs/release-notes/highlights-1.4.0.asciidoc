==== Support for Elastic Agent

link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-overview.html[Elastic Agent] is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each Kubernetes node. With a single agent, it's easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure; also there is no need to deploy multiple instances of Beats for different kinds of data you want to monitor. ECK 1.4.0 introduces experimental support for Elastic Agent in link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/run-elastic-agent-standalone.html[standalone mode] as a technology preview.
