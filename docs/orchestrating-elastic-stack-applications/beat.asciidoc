[id="{p}-beat-configuration"]
== Configuration

[id="{p}-beat-upgrade-specification"]
=== Upgrade the Beat specification

Any setting can be changed in the Beat YAML specification, including version upgrades. ECK detects those changes and ensures a smooth rolling upgrade of all Beat Pods. Depending on specification settings used, ECK will set the <<{p}-beat-set-beat-output,output>> part of the config, perform Kibana dashboard <<{p}-beat-set-up-kibana-dashboards,setup>>, restart Beats on certificates rollover and set up the Beats <<{p}-beat-secrets-keystore-for-secure-settings,keystore>>.

[id="{p}-beat-custom-configuration"]
=== Customize Beat configuration

The Beat configuration is provided through the `config` element:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  type: heartbeat

      spec:
        dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 0

For more details about Beats configuration, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/beats-reference.html[Beats documentation].

[id="{p}-beat-deploy-elastic-beat"]
=== Deploy a Beat

ECK supports the deployment of the following Beats:

- link:https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat[Filebeat]
- link:https://www.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat[Metricbeat]
- link:https://www.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat[Heartbeat]
- link:https://www.elastic.co/beats/auditbeat[Auditbeat]
- link:https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat[Packetbeat]
- link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/journalbeat/current/index.html[Journalbeat]

You can specify the Beat to deploy and its version through `type` and `version` elements. ECK creates a new user in Elasticsearch with a minimal set of appropriate roles and permissions to enable the use of all Beats features.

[id="{p}-beat-deploy-community-beat"]
=== Deploy a Community Beat

ECK supports the deployment of any Community Beat. `type` and `version` specification elements have to be provided. In addition:

1. `image` element in the specification must point to the image to be deployed
2. the following roles must exist in Elasticsearch:
- if `elasticsearchRef` is provided, a role with `eck_beat_es_$type_role` name must exist, where `$type` is the Beat type. For example, when deploying `kafkabeat`, the role name would be `eck_beat_es_kafkabeat_role`. This role must have the permissions required by the Beat. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html[Elasticsearch documentation] for more details.
- if `kibanaRef` is provided, then, as above, a role named `eck_beat_kibana_$type_role` must exist with the permissions required to setup Kibana dashboards.

Alternatively, create a user in Elasticsearch and include the credentials in the Beats `config` for Elasticsearch output, Kibana setup or both. If `elasticsearchRef` and `kibanaRef` are also defined, ECK will use the provided user credentials when setting up the connections.

[id="{p}-beat-set-up-kibana-dashboards"]
=== Set up Kibana dashboards

ECK can instruct Beats to set up example dashboards packaged with the Beat. To enable this, set the `kibanaRef` element in the specification to point to ECK-managed Kibana deployment:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  kibanaRef:
    name: quickstart
...
----

ECK will create a new user in Elasticsearch with a minimal set of appropriate roles and permissions that is needed for dashboard setup.


[id="{p}-beat-secrets-keystore-for-secure-settings"]
=== Secrets keystore for secure settings

Beats offer a secret keystore for sensitive settings that need to be provided in the config, for example passwords. This avoids storing them in the config directly.

ECK exposes that mechanism with the `secureSettings` element in the specification. <<{p}-es-secure-settings,Similar to Elasticsearch>>, you can use Kubernetes Secrets to provide the settings securely:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  secureSettings:
  - secretName: agent-name-secret
  config:
    name: ${AGENT_NAME_VAR}
...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: agent-name-secret
stringData:
  AGENT_NAME_VAR: id_007
----

See link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/keystore.html[Beats documentation] for more details.


[id="{p}-beat-set-beat-output"]
=== Set Beat output

If the `elasticsearchRef` element is specified, ECK populates the output section of the Beat config. ECK creates a user with appropriate roles and permissions and uses its credentials. If required, it also mounts the CA certificate in all Beat Pods, and recreates Pods when this certificate changes.

Output can be set to any value that is supported by a given Beat. To use it, remove the `elasticsearchRef` element from the specification and include an appropriate output configuration in the `config` or `configRef` elements.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  config:
    output.kafka:
      hosts: ["kafka1.default.svc:9092", "kafka2.default.svc:9092"]
      topic: '%{[fields.log_topic]}'
      partition.round_robin:
        reachable_only: false
      required_acks: 1
...
----

[id="{p}-beat-chose-the-deployment-model"]
=== Choose the deployment model

Depending on the use case, Beats may need to be deployed as a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment] or a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[DaemonSet]. Provide a `podTemplate` element under either the `deployment` or the `daemonSet` element in the specification to choose how a given Beat should be deployed.

[id="{p}-beat-role-based-access-control-for-beats"]
=== Role Based Access Control for Beats

Some Beats features (such as link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-autodiscover.html[autodiscover] or Kubernetes module link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-kubernetes-apiserver.html[metricsets]) require that Beat Pods interact with Kubernetes APIs. Specific permissions are needed to allow this functionality. Standard Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[RBAC] rules apply. For example, to allow for autodiscover:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1

[id="{p}-beat-deploying-beats-in-secured-clusters"]
=== Deploying Beats in secured clusters

To deploy Beats in clusters with the Pod Security Policy admission controller enabled, or in OpenShift clusters, you must grant additional permissions to the Service Account used by the Beat Pods. Those Service Accounts must be bound to a Role or ClusterRole that has `use` permission for the required Pod Security Policy or Security Context Constraints. Different Beats and their features might require different settings set in their PSP/SCC.


[id="{p}-beat-configuration-examples"]
== Configuration Examples

Below you can find manifests that address a number of common use cases and can be your starting point in exploring Beats deployed with ECK. These manifests are self-contained and work out-of-the-box on any non-secured Kubernetes cluster. They all contain three-node Elasticsearch cluster and single Kibana instance. All Beat configurations set up Kibana dashboards if they are available for a given Beat and all required RBAC resources.

IMPORTANT: These examples are for illustration purposes only and should not be considered to be production-ready.

CAUTION: Some of these examples use the `node.store.allow_mmap: false` configuration value to avoid configuring memory mapping settings on the underlying host. This could have a significant performance impact on your Elasticsearch clusters and should not be used in production without careful consideration. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-virtual-memory.html for more information.

=== Metricbeat for Kubernetes monitoring

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/metricbeat_hosts.yaml
----

Deploys Metricbeat as a DaemonSet that monitors the host resource usage (CPU, memory, network, filesystem) and Kubernetes resources (Nodes, Pods, Containers, Volumes).

=== Filebeat with autodiscover

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/filebeat_autodiscover.yaml
----

Deploys Filebeat as a DaemonSet with the autodiscover feature enabled. It will collect logs from pods in every namespace and load them to the connected Elasticsearch cluster.

=== Filebeat with autodiscover for metadata

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/filebeat_autodiscover_by_metadata.yaml
----

Deploys Filebeat as a DaemonSet with the autodiscover feature enabled. Logs from pods matching the following criteria will be shipped to the connected Elasticsearch cluster:

- Pod is in `log-namespace` namespace
- Pod has `log-label: "true"` label

=== Filebeat without autodiscover

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/filebeat_no_autodiscover.yaml
----

Deploys Filebeat as a DaemonSet with the autodiscover feature disabled. Uses the entire logs directory on the host as the input source. This configuration does not require any RBAC resources as no Kubernetes APIs are used.

=== Elasticsearch and Kibana Stack Monitoring

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/stack_monitoring.yaml
----

Deploys Metricbeat configured for Elasticsearch and Kibana link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-monitoring.html[Stack Monitoring] and Filebeat using autodiscover. Deploys one monitored Elasticsearch cluster and one monitoring Elasticsearch cluster. You can access the Stack Monitoring app in the monitoring cluster's Kibana. Note: in this example, TLS verification is disabled when Metricbeat communicates with the monitored cluster, which is insecure and should not be used in production. This can be resolved by using custom certificates and configuring Metricbeat to verify them.

=== Heartbeat monitoring Elasticsearch and Kibana health

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/heartbeat_es_kb_heatlh.yaml
----

Deploys Heartbeat as a single Pod deployment that monitors the health of Elasticsearch and Kibana by TCP probing their Service endpoints. Note that Heartbeat expects that Elasticsearch and Kibana are deployed in the `default` namespace.

=== Auditbeat

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/auditbeat_hosts.yaml
----

Deploys Auditbeat as a DaemonSet that checks file integrity and audits file operations on the host system.

=== Journalbeat

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/journalbeat_hosts.yaml
----

Deploys Journalbeat as a DaemonSet that ships data from systemd journals.


=== Packetbeat monitoring DNS and HTTP traffic

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f {beats_url}/packetbeat_dns_http.yaml
----

Deploys Packetbeat as a DaemonSet that monitors DNS on port `53` and HTTP(S) traffic on ports `80`, `8000`, `8080` and `9200`.

[id="{p}-beat-troubleshooting"]
== Troubleshooting

[id="{p}-beat-beat-pods-are-crashing-when-kibanaref-is-specified"]
=== Beat Pods are crashing when kibanaRef is specified

When `kibanaRef` is specified, Beat tries to connect to the Kibana instance. If it's unable to do so, the Beat process exits and the Pod restarts. This may happen when Kibana is not yet up or when Beat user is not yet created in Elasticsearch. The Pod may restart a few times when it is first deployed. Afterwards, the Beat should run successfully.


[id="{p}-beat-configuration-containing-key-null-is-malformed"]
=== Configuration containing key: null is malformed

When `kubectl` is used to modify a resource, it calculates a diff between the user applied and the already existing config. This diff has a special semantics link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396#section-1[defined], that forces the removal of a particular key by setting its value to `null`. When user applied config contains `some_key: null` (or equivalent `some_key: ~`) it's interpreted as an instruction to remove `some_key`, often resulting in a malformed config. In Beat configs, this is often the case with link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/add-cloud-metadata.html[processors]. To avoid this:

- change `some_key: null` to `some_key: {}` - if it doesn't change config semantics
- instead of `config` use `configRef` and reference a Secret containing the config - Secret data doesn't go through the same diffing process
