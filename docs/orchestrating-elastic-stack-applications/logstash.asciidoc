experimental[]

Add the following specification to create a minimal Logstash deployment that will listen to a Beats agent or Elastic Agent configured to send to Logstash on port 5044, create the service and write the output to an Elasticsearch cluster named `quickstart`, created in the link:k8s-quickstart.html[Elasticsearch quickstart].

NOTE: Logstash persistent queues (PQs) and dead letter queues (DLQs) are not currently managed by the Logstash operator, and using them will require you to create and manage your own Volumes and VolumeMounts

[id="{p}-logstash-volumes"]
=== Defining data volumes for Logstash
added:[2.9.0]

WARNING: Volume support for Logstash is a breaking change to earlier versions of ECK and requires you to recreate your Logstash resources.


[id="{p}-volume-claim-settings"]
[discrete]
== Specifying the volume claim settings

By default, a PersistentVolume called `logstash-data` is created, that maps to `/usr/share/logstash/data` for persistent storage, typically used for storage from plugins. The `logstash-data` volume claim is, by default, a small (1Gi) volume, using the standard StorageClass of your Kubernetes cluster, but can be overridden by adding a `spec.volumeClaimTemplate` section named `logstash-data`.

For production workloads, you should define your own volume claim template with the desired storage capacity and (optionally) the Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[storage class] to associate with the persistent volume. To override this volume claim for `data` usages, the name of this volume claim must be `logstash-data`.

This example updates the default data template to increase the storage to `2Gi` for the {ls} data folder:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros,callouts"]
----
apiVersion: logstash.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1
kind: Logstash
metadata:
  name: logstash
spec:
  # some configuration attributes omitted for brevity here

          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
----


Separate storage, for example for Logstash configurations using persistent queues (PQ) and/or dead letter queues (DLQ), can be added by including an additional `spec.volumeClaimTemplate` along with a corresponding `spec.podTemplate.spec.containers.volumeMount` for each requested volume.

This example shows how to setup separate storage for a PQ:

[id="{p}-volume-claim-settings-updates"]
[discrete]
== Updating the volume claim settings

Changes, such as storage class or volume size, are currently forbidden in `spec.volumeClaimTemplates`.
To make these changes, you have to fully delete the {ls} resource, delete and recreate or resize the volume, and create a new {ls} resource.

Before deleting or resizing a persistent queue (PQ) volume, ensure that the queue is empty.
When using the PQ, we recommend setting `queue.drain: true` on the {ls} Pods to ensure that the queue is drained when Pods are shutdown.
Note that you should also increase the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to a large enough value to allow the queue to drain.

This example shows how to configure a {ls} resource to drain the queue and increase the termination grace period.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros,callouts"]
----
apiVersion: logstash.k8s.elastic.co/v1alpha1
kind: Logstash
metadata:
  name: logstash
spec:
  # some configuration attributes omitted for brevity here
  config:
    queue.drain: true
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 604800
----

NOTE: A https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94435[{k8s} known issue]: {k8s} may not honor `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` settings greater than 600.
A queue of a terminated Pod may not be fully drained, even when `queue.drain: true` is set and a high `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is configured.

NOTE: In this technical preview, there is currently no way to drain a dead letter queue (DLQ) automatically before {ls} shuts down.
To manually drain the queue, first stop sending data to it, by either disabling the DLQ feature, or disabling any pipelines that send to a DLQ.
Then wait for events to stop flowing through any pipelines reading from the input.


[id="{p}-emptydir"]
[discrete]
== EmptyDir

If you are not concerned about data loss, you can use an `emptyDir` volume for Logstash data.

[CAUTION]
--
The use of `emptyDir` in a production environment may cause permanent data loss.
Do not use with persistent queues (PQs), dead letter queues (DLQs), or with any plugin that requires persistent storage to keep track of state between restarts of {ls}.

Plugins that require persistent storage include any plugin that stores state locally.
These plugins typically have a configuration parameter that includes the name `path` or `directory`, not including paths to static content, such as certificates or keystores.
Examples include the `sincedb_path` setting for the `file`, `dead_letter_queue` and `s3` inputs, the `last_run_metadata_path` for the `JDBC` input, `aggregate_maps_path` for the `aggregate` filter, and `temporary_directory` for the `s3` output, used to aggregate content before uploading to s3.

[id="{p}-logstash-pipelines-es"]
=== Using Elasticsearch in Logstash pipelines

The `spec.elasticsearchRefs` section provides a mechanism to help configure Logstash to establish a secured connection to one or more ECK managed Elasticsearch clusters. By default, each `elasticsearchRef` will target all nodes in its referenced Elasticsearch cluster. If you want to direct traffic to specific nodes of your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to <<{p}-traffic-splitting>> for more information and examples.

When you use `elasticsearchRefs` in a Logstash pipeline, the Logstash operator creates the necessary resources from the associated Elasticsearch cluster, and provides environment variables to allow these resources to be accessed from the pipeline configuration. 
Environment variables are replaced at runtime with the appropriate values.
The environment variables have a fixed naming convention:

* `NORMALIZED_CLUSTERNAME_ES_HOSTS`
* `NORMALIZED_CLUSTERNAME_ES_USER`
* `NORMALIZED_CLUSTERNAME_ES_PASSWORD`
* `NORMALIZED_CLUSTERNAME_ES_SSL_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY`

where NORMALIZED_CLUSTERNAME is the value taken from the `clusterName` field of the `elasticsearchRef` property, capitalized, and `-` transformed to `_` - eg, prod-es, would becomed PROD_ES.

NOTE: The `clusterName` value should be unique across all referenced Elasticsearches in the same Logstash spec.

[NOTE]
--
The Logstash ECK operator creates a user called `eck_logstash_user_role` when an `elasticsearchRef` is specified. This user has the following permissions:

```
  "cluster": ["monitor", "manage_ilm", "read_ilm", "manage_logstash_pipelines", "manage_index_templates", "cluster:admin/ingest/pipeline/get",],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [ "logstash", "logstash-*", "ecs-logstash", "ecs-logstash-*", "logs-*", "metrics-*", "synthetics-*", "traces-*" ],
      "privileges": ["manage", "write", "create_index", "read", "view_index_metadata"]
    }

```
You can <<{p}-users-and-roles,update user permissions>> to include more indices if the Elasticsearch plugin is expected to use indices other than the default. Check out <<{p}-logstash-configuration-custom-index, Logstash configuration with a custom index>> sample configuration that creates a user that writes to a custom index.

This example demonstrates how to create a Logstash deployment that connects to
different Elasticsearch instances, one of which is in a separate namespace:

experimental[]

This section contains manifests that illustrate common use cases, and can be your starting point in exploring Logstash deployed with ECK. These manifests are self-contained and work out-of-the-box on any non-secured Kubernetes cluster. They all contain a three-node Elasticsearch cluster and a single Kibana instance.

CAUTION: The examples in this section are for illustration purposes only and should not be considered to be production-ready. Some of these examples use the `node.store.allow_mmap: false` setting on Elasticsearch which has performance implications and should be tuned for production workloads, as described in <<{p}-virtual-memory>>.

=== Setting JVM options


You can change JVM settings by using the `LS_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to override default settings in `jvm.options`. This approach ensures that expected settings from `jvm.options` are set, and only options that explicitly need to be overridden are.

To do, this, set the  `LS_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable in the container definition of your Logstash resource:

----
<1> This will change the maximum and minimum heap size of the JVM on each pod to 2GB

[id="{p}-logstash-keystore"]
=== Setting keystore

You can specify sensitive settings with Kubernetes secrets. ECK automatically injects these settings into the keystore before it starts Logstash.
The ECK operator continues to watch the secrets for changes and will restart Logstash Pods when it detects a change.

NOTE: For the technical preview, the use of settings in the Logstash keystore may impact startup time for Logstash Pods. Startup time will increase linearly for each entry added to the keystore, and this could extend startup time significantly.

The Logstash Keystore can be password protected by setting an environment variable called `LOGSTASH_KEYSTORE_PASS`. Check out https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/keystore.html#keystore-password[Logstash Keystore] documentation for details.

[id="{p}-logstash-custom-plugins"]
== Working with custom plugins

experimental[]

When running {ls} with plugins outside of those included in the standard, distribution, you can install those plugins in one of two ways - either by using an `initContainer` to install plugins before the main container starts, or creating a custom Docker image that includes the installed plugins. Refer to <<{p}-bundles-plugins>> for a run down of which option might be most suitable for you.

To add plugins, both of these options require the `bin/logstash-plugin` utility to be run to add the plugin(s) to the {ls} pod before it starts.

=== Adding a plugin using an initContainer

This example sets up an `initContainer` to install the `logstash-filter-tld` plugin:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: install-plugins
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-tld"]
----

The init container inherits:

* The image of the main container image, if one is not explicitly set.
* The volume mounts from the main container unless a volume mount with the same name and mount path is present in the init container definition.
* The Pod name and IP address environment variables.


=== Adding a plugin using a custom image

This example installs the same plugin, but uses a custom image to install the plugin.

First, create a Dockerfile based on the {ls} Docker image, running `bin/logstash-plugin install` to install the appropriate plugin(s):

[subs="attributes,+macros,callouts"]
----
FROM docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:{version}

RUN bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-tld
----

Then after building and deploying the custom image (refer to <<{p}-custom-images>> for more details), include it in the {ls} manifest:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  count: 1
  version: {version} <1>
  image: <CUSTOM_IMAGE>
----
<1> Providing the correct version is always required as ECK reasons about APIs and capabilities available to it based on the version field.


[id="{p}-logstash-jar-files"]
== Working with plugins that require additional files

Running {ls} may require additional files, such as JAR files needed to load JDBC drivers when using a JDBC or JMS plugin. To add these files, there are two options available - using an `initContainer` to add files before the main container start, or creating a custom Docker image that includes the required files. Refer to <<{p}-bundles-plugins>> for a run down of which option might be most suitable for you.


=== Adding files using an initContainer

This example creates an `initContainer` to download a PostgreSQL JDBC driver JAR file, and place it in a volume mount accessible to the main `container`, and then use it in a JDBC input in the pipeline configuration.

             <2>
          }
        }
----
<1> Referring to the external file should match the `mountPath` of the `container`
<2> Remainder of plugin configuration goes here

=== Adding files using a custom image

This example downloads the same `postgres` JDBC driver, and adds it to the {ls} classpath in the Docker image.

First, create a Dockerfile based on the {ls} Docker image.
Download the JDBC driver, and save it alongside the other JAR files in the {ls} classpath:

From docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:{version}, run: 
[source,js]
----
curl -o /usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/jars/postgresql.jar -L https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.6.0.jar <1>
----
<1> Placing the JAR file in the `/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/jars` folder adds it to the {ls} classpath.

After you build and deploy the custom image, include it in the {ls} manifest.
(Check out <<{p}-custom-images>> for more details.)

----
  count: 1
  version: {version} <1>

[id="{p}-logstash-scaling-logstash"]
== Scaling Logstash

experimental[]

The ability to scale {ls} is highly dependent on the pipeline configurations, and the plugins used in those pipelines. Not all {ls} deployments can be scaled horizontally by increasing the number of {ls} Pods defined in the Logstash resource.
Increasing the number of Pods can cause data loss/duplication, or Pods running idle because they are unable to be utilized.

These risks are especially likely with plugins that:

* Retrieve data from external sources.
** Plugins that retrieve data from external sources, and require some level of coordination between nodes to split up work, are not good candidates for scaling horizontally, and would likely produce some data duplication. These are plugins such as the JDBC input plugin, which has no automatic way to split queries across Logstash instances, or the S3 input, which has no way to split which buckets to read across Logstash instances.
** Plugins that retrieve data from external sources, where work is distributed externally to Logstash, but may impose their own limits. These are plugins like the Kafka input, or Azure event hubs, where the parallelism is limited by the number of partitions vs the number of consumers. In cases like this, extra Logstash Pods may be idle if the number of consumer threads multiplied by the number of Pods is greater than the number of partitions.
* Plugins that require events to be received in order.
** Certain plugins, such as the aggregate filter, expect events to be received in strict order to run without error or data loss. Any plugin that requires the number of pipeline workers to be `1` will also have issues when horizontal scaling is used.
 If the pipeline does not contain any such plugin, the number of Logstash instances can be increased by setting the `count` property in the Logstash resource:

[id="{p}-logstash-technical-preview-limitations"]
== Technical Preview limitations

experimental[]

Note that this release is a technical preview. It is still under active development and has additional limitations:

[id="{p}-logstash-technical-preview-persistence"]
=== Experimental support for persistence
NOTE: Persistence (experimental) is a breaking change from version 2.8.0 of the ECK operator and requires re-creation of existing {ls} resources.

The operator now includes support for persistence.
It creates a small (`1Gi`) default `PersistentVolume` called `logstash-data` that maps to `/usr/share/logstash/data`, typically used for storage from plugins.
The default volume can be overridden by adding a `spec.volumeClaimTemplate` section named `logstash-data` to add more storage, or to use a different `storageClass` from the default, for example.
You can define additional `persistentVolumeClaims` in `spec.volumeClaimTemplate` for use with PQ, or DLQ, for example.

The current implementation does not allow resizing of volumes, even if your chosen storage class would support it.
To resize a volume, delete the {ls} resource, delete and recreate (or resize) the volume, and create a new {ls} resource.
Note that volume claims will not be deleted when you delete the {ls} resource, and must be deleted manually.
This behavior might change in future versions of the ECK operator.

[id="{p}-logstash-technical-preview-elasticsearchref"]
=== `ElasticsearchRef` implementation in plugins is in preview mode
Adding Elasticsearch to plugin definitions requires the use of environment variables populated by the Logstash operator, which may change in future versions of the Logstash operator.

[id="{p}-logstash-technical-preview-limted-plugins"]
=== Limited support for plugins

Not all {ls} plugins are supported for this technical preview. 
Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and plugins outside of the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#logstash_plugins[Logstash plugin matrix] have not been considered for this list.

**Supported plugins**

These plugins have been tested and are supported:

* logstash-input-beats
* logstash-input-elastic_agent
* logstash-input-kafka
* logstash-input-tcp
* logstash-input-http
* logstash-input-udp

Most filter and output plugins are supported, with some exceptions noted in the next section. 

**Plugins not supported at technical preview**

These plugins are not supported: 

* logstash-filter-jdbc_static
* logstash-filter-jdbc_streaming
* logstash-filter-aggregate

**Plugins that may require additional manual work** 

Other {ls} filter and output plugins work, but require additional manual steps to mount volumes for certain configurations. 
For example, logstash-output-s3 requires mounting a volume to store in-progress work to avoid data loss.
