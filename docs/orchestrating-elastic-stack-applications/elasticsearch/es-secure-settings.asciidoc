= Secure settings

You can specify link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/secure-settings.html[secure settings] with Kubernetes secrets.
The secrets should contain a key-value pair for each secure setting you want to add. ECK automatically injects these settings into the keystore on each Elasticsearch node before it starts Elasticsearch.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  secureSettings:
  - secretName: one-secure-settings-secret
  - secretName: two-secure-settings-secret
----

You can export a subset of secret keys and also project keys to specific paths using the `entries`, `key` and `path` fields:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  secureSettings:
  - secretName: your-secure-settings-secret
    entries:
    - key: key1
    - key: key2
      path: newkey2
----

See <<{p}-snapshots,How to create automated snapshots>> for an example use case.
