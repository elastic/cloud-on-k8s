= HTTP settings and TLS SANs

In the `spec.http.service.spec` section, you can change the Kubernetes service used to expose Elasticsearch:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  http:
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
----

Check the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types[Kubernetes Publishing Services (ServiceTypes)] that are currently available.

You can add an IP or a DNS name in the SAN of the self-signed certificate configured by default to secure the HTTP layer with TLS in the `spec.http.tls.selfSignedCertificate` section.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  http:
    tls:
      selfSignedCertificate:
        subjectAltNames:
        - ip: 1.2.3.4
        - dns: hulk.example.com
