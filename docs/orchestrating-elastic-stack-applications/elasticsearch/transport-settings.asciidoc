= Transport settings

The transport module in Elasticsearch is used for internal communication between nodes within the cluster as well as communication between remote clusters. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-transport.html[Elasticsearch documentation] for details.

In the `spec.transport.service.` section, you can change the Kubernetes service used to expose the Elasticsearch transport module:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  transport:
    service:
      metadata:
        labels:
          my-custom: label
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
----

Check the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types[Kubernetes Publishing Services (ServiceTypes)] that are currently available.

NOTE: When you change the `clusterIP` setting of the service, ECK deletes and re-creates the service, as `clusterIP` is an immutable field. This will cause a short network disruption, but in most cases it should not affect existing connections as the transport module uses long-lived TCP connections.
