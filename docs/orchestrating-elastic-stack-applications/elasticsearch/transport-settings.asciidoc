= Transport settings

The transport module in Elasticsearch is used for internal communication between nodes within the cluster as well as communication between remote clusters. See the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-transport.html[Elasticsearch documentation] for details.

== Customize the Transport Service

In the `spec.transport.service.` section, you can change the Kubernetes service used to expose the Elasticsearch transport module:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  transport:
    service:
      metadata:
        labels:
          my-custom: label
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
----

Check the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types[Kubernetes Publishing Services (ServiceTypes)] that are currently available.

NOTE: When you change the `clusterIP` setting of the service, ECK deletes and re-creates the service, as `clusterIP` is an immutable field. This will cause a short network disruption, but in most cases it should not affect existing connections as the transport module uses long-lived TCP connections. 

== Configure a custom Certificate Authority

Elasticsearch uses X.509 certificates to establish encrypted and authenticated connections across nodes in the cluster. By default, ECK creates a self-signed CA certificate to issue a certificate link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/configuring-tls.html#node-certificates[for each node in the cluster].

You can use a Kubernetes secret to provide your own CA instead of the self-signed certificate that ECK will then use to create node certificates for transport connections.
The CA certificate must be stored in the secret under `ca.crt` and the private key must be stored under `ca.key`.

You need to reference the name of a secret that contains the TLS private key and the CA certificate, in the `spec.transport.tls.certificate` section, as shown in this example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  transport:
    tls:
      certificate:
        secretName: custom-ca
----
