= Remote clusters

The link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-remote-clusters.html[remote clusters module] in Elasticsearch enables you to establish uni-directional connections to a remote cluster. This functionality is used in cross-cluster replication and cross-cluster search.

When using remote cluster connections with ECK, the setup process depends on where the remote cluster is deployed.

== Connect from an Elasticsearch cluster running in the same Kubernetes cluster

NOTE: The remote clusters feature requires a valid Enterprise license or Enterprise trial license. Check <<{p}-licensing,the license documentation>> for more details about managing licenses.

To create a remote cluster connection to another Elasticsearch cluster deployed within the same Kubernetes cluster, specify the `remoteClusters` attribute in your Elasticsearch spec.

=== Security Models

ECK supports two different security models: the API key based security model, and the certificate security model. These two security models are described in the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/remote-clusters.html#remote-clusters-security-models[Remote clusters] section of the {es} documentation.

=== Using the API key security model

To enable the API key security model you must first enable the remote cluster server on the remote {es} cluster:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: cluster-two
  namespace: ns-two
spec:
  version: {version}
  remoteClusterServer:
    enabled: true
  nodeSets:
    - name: default
      count: 3
----

NOTE: Enabling the remote cluster server triggers a restart of the {es} cluster.

Once the remote cluster server is enabled and started on the remote cluster you can configure the Elasticsearch reference on the local cluster to include the desired permissions for cross-cluster search, and cross-cluster replication.

Permissions have to be included under the `apiKey` field. The API model of the Elasticsearch resource is compatible with the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key.html#security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key-request-body[{es} Cross-Cluster API key API] model. Fine-grained permissions can therefore be configured in both the `search` and `replication` fields:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/{eck_crd_version}
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: cluster-one
  namespace: ns-one
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - count: 3
    name: default
  remoteClusters:
  - name: cluster-two
    elasticsearchRef:
      name: cluster-two
      namespace: ns-two
      apiKey:
        access:
          search:
            names:
              - kibana_sample_data_ecommerce  <1>
          replication:
            names:
              - kibana_sample_data_ecommerce  <1>
  version: {version}
----

<1> This requires the sample data: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html#gs-get-data-into-kibana

You can find a complete example in the link:{eck_github}/tree/{eck_release_branch}/config/recipes/remoteclusters[recipes directory].

=== Using the certificate security model

The following example describes how to configure `cluster-two` as a remote cluster in `cluster-one` using the certificate security model:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/{eck_crd_version}
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: cluster-one
  namespace: ns-one
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - count: 3
    name: default
  remoteClusters:
  - name: cluster-two
    elasticsearchRef:
      name: cluster-two
      namespace: ns-two <1>
  version: {version}
----

<1> The namespace declaration can be omitted if both clusters reside in the same namespace.

== Connect from an Elasticsearch cluster running outside the Kubernetes cluster

NOTE: While it is technically possible to configure remote cluster connections using older versions of Elasticsearch, this guide only covers the setup for Elasticsearch 7.6 and later. The setup process is significantly simplified in Elasticsearch 7.6 due to improved support for the indirection of Kubernetes services.

You can configure a remote cluster connection to an ECK-managed Elasticsearch cluster from another cluster running outside the Kubernetes cluster as follows:

. Make sure that both clusters trust each other's certificate authority.
. Configure the remote cluster connection through the Elasticsearch REST API.

Consider the following example:

* `cluster-one` resides inside Kubernetes and is managed by ECK
* `cluster-two` is not hosted inside the same Kubernetes cluster as `cluster-one` and may not even be managed by ECK

To configure `cluster-one` as a remote cluster in `cluster-two`:


=== Make sure both clusters trust each other's certificate authority

The certificate authority (CA) used by ECK to issue certificates for the Elasticsearch transport layer is stored in a secret named `<cluster_name>-es-transport-certs-public`. Extract the certificate for `cluster-one` as follows:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl get secret cluster-one-es-transport-certs-public \
-o go-template='{{index .data "ca.crt" | base64decode}}' > remote.ca.crt
----

You then need to configure the CA as one of the trusted CAs in `cluster-two`. If that cluster is hosted outside of Kubernetes, take the CA certificate that you have just extracted and add it to the list of CAs in link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-settings.html#_pem_encoded_files_3[`xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate_authorities`].

NOTE: Beware of copying the source Secret as-is into a different namespace. Check <<{p}-common-problems-owner-refs, Common Problems: Owner References>> for more information.

NOTE: CA certificates are automatically rotated after one year by default. You can link:k8s-operator-config.html[configure] this period. Make sure to keep the copy of the certificates Secret up-to-date.

If `cluster-two` is also managed by an ECK instance, proceed as follows:

. Create a config map with the CA certificate you just extracted:
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl create configmap remote-certs --from-file=ca.crt=remote.ca.crt
----

. Use this config map to configure `cluster-one`'s CA as a trusted CA in `cluster-two`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/{eck_crd_version}
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: cluster-two
spec:
  transport:
    tls:
      certificateAuthorities:
        configMapName: remote-certs
  nodeSets:
  - count: 3
    name: default
  version: {version}
----

. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to add the CA of `cluster-two` to `cluster-one` as well.

=== Configure the remote cluster connection through the Elasticsearch REST API

Expose the transport layer of `cluster-one`.

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/{eck_crd_version}
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: cluster-one
spec:
  transport:
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer <1>
----
<1> On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting the type field to LoadBalancer provisions a load balancer for your Service. Alternatively, expose the service through one of the Kubernetes Ingress controllers that support TCP services.

Finally, configure `cluster-one` as a remote cluster in `cluster-two` using the Elasticsearch REST API:

[source,sh]
----
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster": {
      "remote": {
        "cluster-one": {
          "mode": "proxy", <1>
          "proxy_address": "${LOADBALANCER_IP}:9300" <2>
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Use "proxy" mode as `cluster-two` will be connecting to `cluster-one` through the Kubernetes service abstraction.
<2> Replace `${LOADBALANCER_IP}` with the IP address assigned to the `LoadBalancer` configured in the previous code sample. If you have configured a DNS entry for the service, you can use the DNS name instead of the IP address as well.
