= Virtual memory

By default, Elasticsearch uses memory mapping (`mmap`) to efficiently access indices.
Usually, default values for virtual address space on Linux distributions are too low for Elasticsearch to work properly, which may result in out-of-memory exceptions. This is why link:k8s-quickstart.html[the quickstart example] disables `mmap` via the `node.store.allow_mmap: false` setting. For production workloads, it is strongly recommended to increase the kernel setting `vm.max_map_count` to `262144` and leave `node.store.allow_mmap` unset.

The kernel setting `vm.max_map_count=262144` can be set on the host either directly or by a dedicated init container, which must be privileged. To add an init container that changes the host kernel setting before your Elasticsearch pod starts, you can use the following example Elasticsearch spec:
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros"]
----
cat $$<<$$EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/{eck_crd_version}
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  version: {version}
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 3
    config:
      node.master: true
      node.data: true
      node.ingest: true
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        initContainers:
        - name: sysctl
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          command: ['sh', '-c', 'sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144']
EOF

Note that this requires the ability to run privileged containers, which is likely not the case on many secure clusters.

For more information, see the Elasticsearch documentation on
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html[Virtual memory].

Optionally, you can select a different type of file system implementation for the storage. For possible options, see the
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-store.html[store module documentation].
