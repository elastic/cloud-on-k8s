= JVM heap size

To change the heap size of Elasticsearch, set the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable in the `podTemplate`. It is also highly recommended to set the resource `requests` and `limits` at the same time to ensure that the pod gets enough resources allocated within the Kubernetes cluster. See <<{p}-compute-resources-elasticsearch>> for an example and more information.

If `ES_JAVA_OPTS` is not defined, the Elasticsearch default heap size of 1Gi will be in effect.
