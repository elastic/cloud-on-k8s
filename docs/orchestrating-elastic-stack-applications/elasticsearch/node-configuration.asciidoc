= Node configuration

Any setting defined in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file can also be defined for a set of Elasticsearch nodes in the `spec.nodeSets[?].config` section.

Some settings are managed by ECK, it is not recommended to change them, refer to <<{p}-reserved-settings>> for more details.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - name: masters
    count: 3
    config:
      # On Elasticsearch versions before 7.9.0, replace the node.roles configuration with the following:
      # node.master: true
      node.roles: ["master"]
      xpack.ml.enabled: true
  - name: data
    count: 10
    config:
      # On Elasticsearch versions before 7.9.0, replace the node.roles configuration with the following:
      # node.master: false
      # node.data: true
      # node.ingest: true
      # node.ml: true
      # node.transform: true
      node.roles: ["data", "ingest", "ml", "transform"]

For more information on Elasticsearch settings, check https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html[Configuring Elasticsearch].

WARNING: ECK parses Elasticsearch configuration and normalizes it to YAML. Consequently, some Elasticsearch configuration schema are impossible to express with ECK and, therefore, must be set using https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html#cluster-setting-types[dynamic cluster settings]. E.g.:
  ```
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - name: data
    # ...
    config:
      cluster.max_shards_per_node: 1000
      cluster.max_shards_per_node.frozen: 1000 # <= This won't work because cluster.max_shards_per_node is defined as a scalar value on the previous line
    # ...
  ```
