= Init containers for plugin downloads

You can install custom plugins before the Elasticsearch container starts with an `initContainer`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 3
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        initContainers:
        - name: install-plugins
          command:
          - sh
          - -c
          - |
            bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch analysis-icu
----

You can also override the Elasticsearch container image to use your own image with the plugins already installed, as described in <<{p}-custom-images,custom images>>. For more information on both these options, you can check the <<{p}-snapshots,Create automated snapshots>> section and the Kubernetes documentation on https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init containers].

The init container inherits:

* The image of the main container image, if one is not explicitly set.
* The volume mounts from the main container unless a volume mount with the same name and mount path is present in the init container definition
* The Pod name and IP address environment variables.
