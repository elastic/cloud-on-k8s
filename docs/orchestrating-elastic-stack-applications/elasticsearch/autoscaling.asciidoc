= Elasticsearch autoscaling

NOTE: Elasticsearch autoscaling requires a valid Enterprise license or Enterprise trial license. Check <<{p}-licensing,the license documentation>> for more details about managing licenses.

ECK can leverage the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/autoscaling-apis.html[autoscaling API] introduced in Elasticsearch 7.11 to adjust automatically the number of Pods and the allocated resources in a tier. Currently, autoscaling is supported for Elasticsearch link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-tiers.html[data tiers] and machine learning nodes.

[float]
[id="{p}-enable"]
== Enable autoscaling

To enable autoscaling on an Elasticsearch cluster, you need to define one or more autoscaling policies. Each autoscaling policy applies to one or more NodeSets which share the same set of roles specified in the `node.roles` setting in the Elasticsearch configuration.

[float]
[id="{p}-{page_id}-policies"]
=== Define autoscaling policies

Autoscaling policies can be defined in an `ElasticsearchAutoscaler` resource. Each autoscaling policy must have the following fields:

* `name` is a unique name used to identify the autoscaling policy.
* `roles` contains a set of node roles, unique across all the autoscaling policies, used to identify the NodeSets to which this policy applies. At least one NodeSet with the exact same set of roles must exist in the Elasticsearch resource specification.
* `resources` helps define the minimum and maximum compute resources usage:
** `nodeCount` defines the minimum and maximum nodes allowed in the tier.
** `cpu` and `memory` enforce minimum and maximum compute resources usage for the Elasticsearch container.
** `storage` enforces minimum and maximum storage request per PersistentVolumeClaim.

WARNING: A node role should not be referenced in more than one autoscaling policy.

In the case of storage the following restrictions apply:

- Scaling the storage size automatically requires the `ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes` feature to be enabled. It also requires a storage class that supports link:https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/[volume expansion].
- Only one persistent volume claim per Elasticsearch node is supported when autoscaling is enabled.
- Volume size cannot be scaled down.
- Scaling up (vertically) is only supported if the available capacity in a PersistentVolume matches the capacity claimed in the PersistentVolumeClaim. Refer to the next section for more information.

[id="{p}-{page_id}-algorithm"]
=== Scale Up and Scale Out

In order to adapt the resources to the workload, the operator first attempts to scale up the resources (cpu, memory, and storage) allocated to each node in the NodeSets. The operator always ensures that the requested resources are within the limits specified in the autoscaling policy.
If each individual node has reached the limits specified in the autoscaling policy, but more resources are required to handle the load, then the operator adds some nodes to the NodeSets. Nodes are added up to the `max` value specified in the `nodeCount` of the policy.

WARNING: Scaling up (vertically) is only supported if the actual storage capacity of the persistent volumes matches the capacity claimed. If the physical capacity of a PersistentVolume may be greater than the capacity claimed in the PersistentVolumeClaim, it is advised to set the same value for the `min` and the `max` setting of each resource. It is however still possible to let the operator scale out the NodeSets automatically, as in the following example:

[id="{p}-{page_id}-resources"]
=== Set the limits

The value set for memory and CPU limits are computed by applying a ratio to the calculated resource request. The default ratio between the request and the limit for both CPU and memory is 1. This means that request and limit have the same value. You can change the default ratio between the request and the limit for both the CPU and memory ranges by using the `requestsToLimitsRatio` field.

For example, you can set a CPU limit to twice the value of the request, as follows:

=== Autoscaling status

In addition to the logs generated by the operator, an autoscaling status is maintained in the `ElasticsearchAutoscaler` resource. This status holds several `Conditions` to summarize the health and the status of the autoscaling mechanism. For example, dedicated `Conditions` may report if the controller cannot connect to the Elasticsearch cluster, or if a resource limit has been reached:

[float]
[id="{p}-disable"]
== Disable autoscaling

You can disable autoscaling at any time by deleting the `ElasticsearchAutoscaler` resource. For machine learning the following settings are not automatically reset:

- `xpack.ml.max_ml_node_size`
- `xpack.ml.max_lazy_ml_nodes`
- `xpack.ml.use_auto_machine_memory_percent`

You should adjust those settings manually to match the size of your deployment when you disable autoscaling.
