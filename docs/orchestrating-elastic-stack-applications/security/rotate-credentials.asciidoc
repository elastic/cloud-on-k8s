= Rotate auto-generated credentials

When deploying an Elastic Stack application, the operator generates a set of credentials essential for the operation of that application. For example, these generated credentials include the default `elastic` user for Elasticsearch and the security token for APM Server. 

To list all auto-generated credentials in a namespace, run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl get secret -l eck.k8s.elastic.co/credentials=true
----

You can force the auto-generated credentials to be regenerated with new values by deleting the appropriate Secret. For example, to change the password for the `elastic` user from the <<{p}-quickstart,quickstart example>>, use the following command:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl delete secret quickstart-es-elastic-user
----

CAUTION: If you are using the `elastic` user credentials in your own applications, they will fail to connect to Elasticsearch and Kibana after you run this command. It is not recommended to use `elastic` user credentials for production use cases. Always <<{p}-users-and-roles,create your own users with restricted roles>> to access Elasticsearch.

To regenerate all auto-generated credentials in a namespace, run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl delete secret -l eck.k8s.elastic.co/credentials=true
----

CAUTION: This command regenerates auto-generated credentials of *all* Elastic Stack applications in the namespace.
