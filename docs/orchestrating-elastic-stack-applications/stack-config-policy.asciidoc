NOTE: This requires a valid Enterprise license or Enterprise trial license. Check <<{p}-licensing,the license documentation>> for more details about managing licenses.

Starting from ECK `2.6.1` and Elasticsearch `8.6.1`, Elastic Stack configuration policies allow you to configure the following settings for Elasticsearch:

- <<{p}-{page_id}-specifics-secret-mounts,Secret Mounts>> added:[ECK 2.11.0]

Additionally with ECK `2.11.0` it is posssible to configure Kibana as well using Elastic Stack configuration policies, the following settings can be configured for Kibana:

- link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html[Kibana Configuration] (configuration settings for Kibana that will go into `kibana.yml`)
- <<{p}-kibana-secure-settings,Kibana Secure Settings>>

A policy can be applied to one or more Elasticsearch clusters or Kibana instances in any namespace managed by the ECK operator.
Configuration policy settings applied by the ECK operator are immutable through the Elasticsearch REST API.
It is currently not allowed to configure an Elasticsearch cluster or Kibana instance with more than one policy.

== Define Elastic Stack configuration policies

Elastic Stack configuration policies can be defined in a `StackConfigPolicy` resource. Each `StackConfigPolicy` must have the following field:

* `name` is a unique name used to identify the policy.

At least one of `spec.elasticsearch` or `spec.kibana` needs to be defined with at least one of its attributes.

* `spec.elasticsearch` describes the settings to configure for Elasticsearch. Each of the following fields except `clusterSettings` is an associative array where keys are arbitrary names and values are definitions:
  ** `clusterSettings` are dynamic settings that can be set on a running cluster like with the Cluster Update Settings API.
  ** `snapshotRepositories` are snapshot repositories for defining an off-cluster storage location for your snapshots. Check <<{p}-{page_id}-specifics-snap-repo>> for more information.
  ** `snapshotLifecyclePolicies` are snapshot lifecycle policies, to automatically take snapshots and control how long they are retained.
  ** `securityRoleMappings` are role mappings, to define which roles are assigned to each user by identifying them through rules.
  ** `ingestPipelines` are ingest pipelines, to perform common transformations on your data before indexing.
  ** `indexLifecyclePolicies` are index lifecycle policies, to automatically manage the index lifecycle.
  ** `indexTemplates.componentTemplates` are component templates that are building blocks for constructing index templates that specify index mappings, settings, and aliases.
  ** `indexTemplates.composableIndexTemplates` are index templates to define settings, mappings, and aliases that can be applied automatically to new indices.
  ** `config` are the settings that go into the `elasticsearch.yml` file.
  ** `secretMounts` are the additional user created secrets that need to be mounted to the Elasticsearch Pods.
  ** `secureSettings` is a list of Secrets containing Secure Settings to inject into the keystore(s) of the Elasticsearch cluster(s) to which this policy applies, similar to the <<{p}-es-secure-settings,Elasticsearch Secure Settings>>.
* `spec.kibana` describes the settings to configure for Kibana.
  ** `config` are the settings that go into the `kibana.yml` file.
  ** `secureSettings` is a list of Secrets containing Secure Settings to inject into the keystore(s) of the Kibana instance(s) to which this policy applies, similar to the <<{p}-kibana-secure-settings,Kibana Secure Settings>>.

The following fields are optional:

* `namespace` is the namespace of the `StackConfigPolicy` resource and used to identify the Elasticsearch clusters to which this policy applies. If it equals to the operator namespace, the policy applies to all namespaces managed by the operator, otherwise the policy only applies to the namespace of the policy.
* `resourceSelector` is a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/[label selector] to identify the Elasticsearch clusters to which this policy applies in combination with the namespace(s). No `resourceSelector` means all Elasticsearch clusters in the namespace(s).

Example of applying a policy that configures snapshot repository, SLM Policies, and cluster settings:

[id="{p}-{page_id}-monitoring"]
== Monitor Elastic Stack configuration policies

In addition to the logs generated by the operator, a config policy status is maintained in the `StackConfigPolicy` resource. This status gives information in which phase the policy is ("Applying", "Ready", "Error") and it indicates the number of resources for which the policy could be applied.

[source,sh]
----
kubectl get stackconfigpolicy
----

[source,sh]
----
NAME                           READY   PHASE   AGE
test-stack-config-policy       1/1     Ready   1m42s
test-err-stack-config-policy   0/1     Error   1m42s
----

When not all resources are ready, you can get more information about the reason by reading the full status:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl get -n b scp test-err-stack-config-policy -o jsonpath="{.status}" | jq .
----

[source,json]

{
  "errors": 1,

      "b/banana-staging": {

          "message": "Error processing slm state change: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error on validating SLM requests\n\tSuppressed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: no such repository [es-snapshots]",
          "version": 1670342482739637500
        },

Important events are also reported through Kubernetes events, such as when two config policies conflict or you don't have the appropriate license:

[source,sh]

[id="{p}-{page_id}-specifics-snap-repo"]
== Specifics for snapshot repositories

In order to avoid a conflict between multiple Elasticsearch clusters writing their snapshots to the same location, ECK automatically:

- sets the `base_path` to `snapshots/<namespace>-<esName>` when it is not provided, for Azure, GCS and S3 repositories
- appends `<namespace>-<esName>` to `location` for a FS repository
- appends `<namespace>-<esName>` to `path` for an HDFS repository

[float]
[id="{p}-{page_id}-specifics-secret-mounts"]
== Specifics for secret mounts

ECK `2.11.0` introduces `spec.elasticsearch.secretMounts` as a new field.
This field allows users to specify a user created secret and a mountPath to indicate where this secret should be mounted in the Elasticsearch Pods that are managed by the Elastic Stack configuration policy.
This field can be used to add additional secrets to the Elasticsearch Pods that may be needed for example for sensitive files required to configure Elasticsearch security realms.
The secret should be created by the user is the same namespace as the Elastic Stack configuration policy.
The operator reads this secret and copies it over to the namespace of Elasticsearch so that it can be mounted by the Elasticsearch Pods.
Example of configuring secret mounts in the Elastic Stack configuration policy:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,+macros,callouts"]
----
secretMounts:
  - secretName: jwks-secret <1>
    mountPath: "/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/jwks" <2>
----

<1> name of the secret created by the user in the Elastic Stack configuration policy namespace.
<2> mount path where the secret must be mounted to inside the Elasticsearch Pod.

== Configuring authentication policies using Elastic Stack configuration policy

Elastic Stack configuration policy can be used to configure authentication for Elasticsearch clusters. Check <<{p}-auth-config-using-stack-config-policy>> for some examples of the various authentication configurations that can be used.
