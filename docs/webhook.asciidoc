=== Validating webhook

A validating webhook provides additional validation of Elasticsearch resources: it provides immediate feedback on the Elasticsearch manifests you submit, allowing you to catch errors right away before ECK even tries to fulfill your request.

=== Architecture
The webhook is composed of 4 main components. Here is a brief description of each of them to understand how they interact, their naming, and how they are managed.

. A `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object that defines the validating webhook, targeting the right webhook path and resource. It must be created before starting the operator. The `caBundle` field can be automatically managed as part of the automatic certificate management _(see below)_.
. A Kubernetes Service is used to expose the validating server, named `elastic-webhook-server`. It is in the same Namespace as the webhook server.
. A webhook server that actually validates the submitted resources. In ECK it is the operator itself when it is configured with the `webhook` role. See <<{p}-operator-config,Configuring ECK>> for more information about the `operator-roles` flag.
. A Secret containing the required certificates to secure the connection between the API server and the webhook server.
Like the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, it must be created before starting the operator, even if it is empty. By default its name is `elastic-webhook-server-cert`.
The content of this Secret and the lifecycle of the certificates are automatically managed for you. ECK generates a dedicated and separate certificate authority and ensures that all components are rotated before the expiration date. The certificate authority is also used to configure the `caBundle` field of the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`. You can disable this feature if you want to manage the certificates yourself or with https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager[cert-manager]. See an example of the latter below.

=== Managing the webhook certificate with cert-manager

If ECK is currently running you first must ensure that the automatic certificate management feature is disabled. This can be done by updating the operator deployment manifest and adding the `--manage-webhook-certs=false` flag.

Then, cert-manager v0.11+ must be installed as described in the https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install/[cert-manager documentation].

The following example shows how to create all the resources that a webhook requires to function.

NOTE: This example assumes that you have installed the operator in the `elastic-system` namespace.

=== Troubleshooting

Webhooks require network connectivity between the Kubernetes API server and the operator.
See <<{p}-webhook-troubleshooting,Webhook troubleshooting>> for more information about some known problems with some Kubernetes providers.
