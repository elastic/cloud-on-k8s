ECK should work with all conformant installers as listed in these link:https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/faq.md#what-is-a-distribution-hosted-platform-and-an-installer[FAQs]. Distributions include source patches and so may not work as-is with ECK.

Alpha, beta, and stable API versions follow the same link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning[conventions used by Kubernetes].

Elastic Stack application images for the OpenShift-certified Elasticsearch (ECK) Operator are only available from version 7.10 and later.
