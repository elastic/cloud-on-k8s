== Configuring ECK

You can use several options to configure ECK. Unless otherwise noted, these options can be set as environment variables or command line flags.

|==========================
|Flag |Type|Default|Description

|`log-verbosity` |int |0 |Verbosity level of logs. -2=Error, -1=Warn, 0=Info, >0=Debug
|`enable-debug-logs` |bool |false |Enables debug logs. Equivalent to `log-verbosity=1`
|`metrics-port` |int |0 |Port to use for exposing metrics in the Prometheus format. Set 0 to disable
|`operator-roles` |[]string |all |Roles this operator should assume. Valid values are namespace, global, webhook or all. Accepts multiple comma separated values.
|`namespaces` |[]string |`""` |Namespaces in which this operator should manage resources. Accepts multiple comma-separated values. Defaults to all namespaces if empty or unspecified.
|`ca-cert-validity` |duration (string) |1y |Duration representing how long before a newly created CA cert expires
|`ca-cert-rotate-before` |duration (string) |1d |Duration representing how long before expiration CA certificates should be reissued
|`cert-validity` |duration (string) |1y |Duration representing how long before a newly created TLS certificate expires
|`cert-rotate-before` |duration (string) |1d |Duration representing how long before expiration TLS certificates should be reissued
|`manage-webhook-certs` |bool |true |Enables automatic webhook certificate management
|`operator-namespace` |string |`""` |K8s namespace the operator runs in
|`webhook-secret` |string |`""` |K8s secret name mounted into /tmp/cert to be used for webhook certificates
|`webhook-pods-label` |string |`""` |K8s label to select pods running the operator
|`development` |bool |false |Enable developmenet mode. Only available as a CLI flag, not an environment variable
|`debug-http-listen` |string |localhost:6060 |Listen address for the debug HTTP server. Only available in development mode
|`auto-port-forward` |bool |false |Enables automatic port forwarding to allow running the operator outside the cluster. For dev use only as it exposes k8s resources on ephemeral ports to localhost
|==========================


Many of these should not need to be modified, but if necessary you can modify the operator YAML. For instance, to enable `DEBUG` level logs on the operator, restart it with the flag `--enable-debug-logs=true` like so:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl edit statefulset.apps -n elastic-system elastic-operator
----

and change the following lines from:

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - manager
      - --operator-roles
      - all
      - --enable-debug-logs=false
----

to:

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - manager
      - --operator-roles
      - all
      - --enable-debug-logs=true
----
