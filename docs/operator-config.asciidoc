Many of these should not need to be modified, but if necessary you can modify the operator YAML. For instance, to enable `DEBUG` level logs on the operator, restart it with the flag `--enable-debug-logs=true` like so:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl edit statefulset.apps -n elastic-system elastic-operator
----

and change the following lines from:

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - manager
      - --operator-roles
      - all
      - --enable-debug-logs=false
----

to

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - manager
      - --operator-roles
      - all
      - --enable-debug-logs=true
----
