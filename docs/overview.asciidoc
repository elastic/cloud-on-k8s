Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) extends the basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities to support the setup and management of {eck_resources_list} on Kubernetes.

With Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes you can streamline critical operations, such as:

. Managing and monitoring multiple clusters
. Scaling cluster capacity and storage
. Performing safe configuration changes through rolling upgrades
. Securing clusters with TLS certificates
. Setting up hot-warm-cold architectures with availability zone awareness
