                            and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints
                            rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP
                            and allocates a port on every node which routes to the
                            clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates

                            cloud) which routes to the clusterIP. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'

                            ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName"
                            maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates
                            a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                            Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
                            not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                            object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated
                            and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints
                            rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP
                            and allocates a port on every node which routes to the
                            clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates
                            an external load-balancer (if supported in the current
                            cloud) which routes to the clusterIP. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'
