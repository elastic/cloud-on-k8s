# ECK Helm Chart Releaser

This tool is designed to handle releasing the ECK Helm charts.  It can both release:

1. A single ECK Helm chart (eck-operator)
2. Multiple ECK Helm charts from a directory (eck resources Helm charts), potentially excluding any named Helm charts.

It is also designed to handle releasing to both production, and non-production Helm Chart repositories.

## Buildkite integration

### Releasing ECK Operator Helm Chart

### Manually releasing the ECK Operator Helm Chart

To manually publish the ECK Operator Helm chart and it's associated CRD chart, run the below `curl` command.

*Note if there are changes to the Helm tooling that are still in a PR status, you'll need to add "pull_request_repository":"git://github.com/your-username/cloud-on-k8s","pull_request_id":"pr-id" to the below API call.*

```
  curl --request POST --url https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/elastic/pipelines/cloud-on-k8s-operator/builds \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer your-bk-token' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "commit": "HEAD",
        "branch": "main",
        "env": {
          "HELM_DRY_RUN": "false",
        },
        "message": "release eck-operator helm chart"
    }'
```

1. Release tool will be run with `--charts-dir` pointing directly to `eck-operator` chart directory (ignoring all eck resource Helm charts), and set to release to dev bucket/repo.
2. If successful, the same operation will be run pointing to production bucket/repo.

You can then track the progress of the build in [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s-operator)

### Releasing ECK Resources Helm Charts

#### Manually releasing the ECK Resources Helm Charts

To manually publish the ECK Resources Helm charts, run the below `curl` command.

*Note if there are changes to the Helm tooling that are still in a PR status, you'll need to add "pull_request_repository":"git://github.com/your-username/cloud-on-k8s","pull_request_id":"pr-id" to the below API call.*

```
  curl --request POST --url https://api.buildkite.com/v2/organizations/elastic/pipelines/cloud-on-k8s-operator/builds \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer your-bk-token' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "commit": "HEAD",
        "branch": "main",
        "env": {
          "HELM_DRY_RUN": "false",
        },
        "message": "release eck-resources helm charts"
    }'
```

1. Release tool will be run with `--charts-dir` pointing directly to `deploy` chart directory (containing all charts, including `eck-operator`), set to release to dev bucket/repo, and with `--excludes` flag set to `eck-operator`.
2. If successful, the same operation will be run pointing to production bucket/repo.

You can then track the progress of the build in [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s-operator)

## Running a Release Manually

The following command will execute the steps

* Release all charts contained within the "path/to/deploy" directory.
* Upload all Helm Chart packages to "elastic-helm-charts-dev" GCS bucket using credentials in "gcs-bucket-credentials.json" file.
* Update Helm index file for "https://helm-dev.elastic.co/helm" Helm repository.

```
releaser --env=dev --charts-dir=path/to/deploy --credentials-file=path/to/gcs-bucket-credentials.json --dry-run=false
```
