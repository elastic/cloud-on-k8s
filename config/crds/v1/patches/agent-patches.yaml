# Using `kubectl apply` stores the complete CRD file as an annotation,
# which may be too big for the annotations size limit.
# One way to mitigate this problem is to remove the (huge) podTemplate properties from the CRD.
# It also avoids the problem of having any k8s-version specific field in the Pod schema,
# that would maybe not match the user's k8s version.
