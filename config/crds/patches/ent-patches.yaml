# Remove validation.openAPIV3Schema.type that causes failures on k8s 1.11.
# This should have been fixed with https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/pull/72, but it looks like
# this commit has been lost in history. See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/296.

# Using `kubectl apply` stores the complete CRD file as an annotation,
# which may be too big for the annotations size limit.
# One way to mitigate this problem is to remove the (huge) podTemplate properties from the CRD.
# It also avoids the problem of having any k8s-version specific field in the Pod schema,
# that would maybe not match the user's k8s version.

# these are not technically required by the API server, but kubectl validation will fail because
# of these markers so we remove them to make applying the CRDs easier.
