= Expose Elasticsearch and Kibana using Istio ingress gateway

This recipe demonstrates the following features:

- Deploying an Elasticsearch cluster with different node types (coordinator, ingest, master, data, ml)
- Enforcing Istio mTLS between Elasticsearch nodes
- Routing read traffic to coordinator nodes and write traffic to ingest nodes (internally and externally)
- Exposing Elasticsearch and Kibana deployments externally using the Istio ingress gateway


NOTE: These manifests were tested with ECK 1.0.1, Istio 1.5.0, and Kubernetes 1.16 (v1.16.6-gke.12) on Google Kubernetes Engine.

== Prerequisites

- Install Istio with the Secret Discovery Service (SDS) enabled
+
[source,sh]
----
istioctl manifest generate \
  --set values.global.mtls.enabled=true \
  --set values.global.sds.enabled=true \
  --set values.kiali.enabled=true \
  --set values.global.proxy.accessLogFile="/dev/stdout" \
  --set values.gateways.istio-egressgateway.enabled=false \
  --set values.gateways.istio-ingressgateway.sds.enabled=true | kubectl apply -f -
----
- Install ECK with the Istio sidecar. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-service-mesh-istio.html
- Enforce mTLS
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::00-prereq-mtls.yaml[]
----
- Create a namespace called `istio-apps` with Istio injection enabled
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::01-prereq-namespace.yaml[]
----
- Install link:https://cert-manager.io[cert-manager] and create a `ClusterIssuer` named `selfsigning-issuer`
+

== Recipe

=== Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana

[source,yaml]
----
include::03-elasticsearch-kibana.yaml[]
----

=== Issue certificates for Elasticsearch and Kibana

We are issuing certificates for made-up domains `elasticsearch.ekmnt` and `kibana.ekmnt` to enforce TLS at the ingress gateway. Note that the certificate secret must be created in the same namespace as the ingress gateway pod (`istio-system` by default).

[source,yaml]
----
include::04-certificates.yaml[]
----

=== Create gateway to expose the Elasticsearch and Kibana deployments

This gateway definition accepts TLS connections on port 443 for the made-up domains we created earlier. Requests made to `elasticsearch.ekmnt` would be directed to the Elasticsearch deployment and requests made to `kibana.ekmnt` would be directed to the Kibana deployment.

[source,yaml]
----
include::05-gateway.yaml[]
----

=== Split Elasticsearch read/write traffic

This virtual service and destination rule splits both internal and external traffic using the following rules:

- `POST` requests to `/_search` or any `GET` requests should be sent to coordinator nodes
- Any other requests (`DELETE`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`) should be sent to ingest nodes

This traffic split applies to internal traffic (mesh) as well as external traffic.

[source,yaml]
----
include::06-es-traffic-split.yaml[]
----

=== Expose Kibana

Note that since we are using made-up domains that do not have valid DNS entries, you will not be able to access Kibana using a browser.

[source,yaml]
----
include::07-kibana.yaml[]
----


== Testing

Obtain the public IP address and HTTPS port of your ingress gateway

[source,sh]
----
INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
SECURE_INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].port}')
----

Obtain the password for the elastic user

[source,sh]
----
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret ekmnt-es-elastic-user -n istio-apps -o=go-template='{{ .data.elastic | base64decode}}')
----

Send a request to Elasticsearch

[source,sh]
----
curl -k \
	--resolve "elasticsearch.ekmnt:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT:$INGRESS_HOST" \
	-u "elastic:$ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD" \
	"https://elasticsearch.ekmnt:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT/_cat/health?v"
----

If you have enabled proxy access logs, you can verify that the above `GET` request was received by the coordinator node by looking at the proxy logs:

[source,sh]
----
kubectl logs -f ekmnt-es-coordinator-0 -n istio-apps -c istio-proxy
----

Alternatively, if you have Kiali installed, your traffic graph might resemble the following:
