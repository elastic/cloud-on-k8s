= Using Logstash with ECK

This recipe demonstrates how to run the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/advanced-pipeline.html[Logstash log parsing example] on Kubernetes with Elasticsearch, Kibana and Filebeat deployed via ECK.


CAUTION: This recipe uses the `node.store.allow_mmap: false` configuration value to avoid configuring memory mapping settings on the underlying host. This could have a significant performance impact on your Elasticsearch cluster and should not be used in production without careful consideration. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-virtual-memory.html for more information.
