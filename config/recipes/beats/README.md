# Beats Configuration Examples

This directory contains yaml manifests with example configurations for Beats. These manifests are self-contained and work out-of-the-box on any non-secured Kubernetes cluster. All of them contain three-node Elasticsearch cluster and single Kibana instance. All Beat configurations set up Kibana dashboards if they are available for a given Beat and all required RBAC resources. 


#### Metricbeat for Kubernetes monitoring - `metricbeat_hosts.yaml`

Deploys Metricbeat as a DaemonSet that monitors the host resource usage (cpu, memory, network, filesystem) and Kubernetes resources (Nodes, Pods, Containers, Volumes).

#### Filebeat with autodiscover - `filebeat_autodiscover.yaml`

Deploys Filebeat as DaemonSet with autodiscover feature enabled. All pods in all namespaces will have logs shipped to an Elasticsearch cluster.

#### Filebeat with autodiscover for metadata - `filebeat_autodiscover_by_metadata.yaml`

Deploys Filebeat as a DaemonSet with autodiscover feature enabled. Fullfilling any of the two conditions below will cause a given Pod's logs to be shipped to an Elasticsearch cluster:

- Pod is in `log-namespace` namespace
- Pod has `log-label: "true"` label 

#### Filebeat without autodiscover - `filebeat_no_autodiscover.yaml`

Deploys Filebeat as a DaemonSet with autodiscover feature disabled. Uses entire logs directory on the host as the input. Doesn't require any RBAC resources as no Kubernetes APIs are used.   

#### Heartbeat monitoring Elasticsearch and Kibana health - `heartbeat_es_kb_heatlh.yaml`

Deploys Heartbeat as a single Pod deployment that monitors the health of Elasticsearch and Kibana by TCP probing their Service endpoints. Note that Heartbeat expects that Elasticsearch and Kibana are deployed in the `default` namespace.

#### Auditbeat - `auditbeat_hosts.yaml`

Deploys Auditbeat as a DaemonSet that checks file integrity and audits file operations on the host system.

#### Journalbeat - `journalbeat_hosts.yaml`

Deploys Journalbeat as a DaemonSet that ships data from systemd journals.

#### Packetbeat monitoring DNS and HTTP traffic - `packetbeat_dns_http.yaml`

Deploys Packetbeat as a DaemonSet that monitors DNS on port `53` and HTTP(S) traffic on ports `80`, `8000`, `8080` and `9200`.
