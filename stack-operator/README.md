# Stack Operator

Manage an Elastic stack in Kubernetes.

## Requirements

* [go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
* [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
* [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
* [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)

## Development

After installing the [requirements](#requirements), you can jump straing to development with `make dev`.
By default it will use `minikube` as the environment to develop against, if you wish to use a GKE cluster use
`make set-dev-gke`. After, you can run `make dev` and the creation of the environment will be taken care of.

###Â Minikube

-> Development environment started
-> Run "make run" to start the manager process localy
```

After that you can run `make start-port-forward` to start forwarding any services you want to interact with from your local controller. This will also create some entries in your `/etc/hosts` file.

`make stop-port-forward` will end the forwarding. 

### GKE Development workflow

When selecting GKE as your development environment note that the controller will be packed in a docker image,
tagged using a hash of the pkg/ directory as a tag and uploaded to a GCP docker image repository. After your GKE
cluster has been created you can build the docker image and deploy the controller by typing `make run`.

After you've performed changes in the controller code you can re-deploy the image by running `make run` again.

### Useful development targets

* `make samples`: Updates the samples.
* `make minikube`: Ensures that minikube is started.
* `make vendor`: Runs `dep ensure`
* `make set-dev-gke`: Sets the development environment to target GKE.
* `make set-dev-minikube`: Sets the development environment to run in `minikube`.
* `make dev-cluster`: Starts / Ensures that the development resources are created and started, to select which environment you want to use, run one of the two targets above. Defaults to `minikube`.
* `make delete-dev`: Deletes the currently set development resources.
* `make purge-env`: Deletes all the resources from the configured Kubernetes cluster on the `default` namespace.
* `make run`: Builds, pushes and deploys the controller's docker image to the GKE cluster or runs the manager locally against the local Minikube environment.



### Makefile variables

* `KUBECTL_CONFIG`: Sets up the config on which to work (defaults to `minikube`.
* `MINIKUBE_KUBERNETES_VERSION`: Configures the Kubernetes version that `minikube` will use for the VM.
* `GCLOUD_PROJECT`: Sets the gcloud project to run aginst (defaults to `elastic-cloud-dev`).
* `GCLOUD_CLUSTER_NAME`: Sets the GKE cluster name to be created (defaults to `${USER}-dev-cluster`).
* `GKE_CLUSTER_REGION`: Sets the gcloud region to run aginst (defaults to `europe-west3`).
* `GKE_ADMIN_USERNAME`: Sets the GKE cluster administrative user (defaults to `admin`).
* `GKE_CLUSTER_VERSION`: Sets the GKE kubernetes version to use (defaults to `1.11.2-gke.15`).
* `GKE_MACHINE_TYPE`: Sets the GCP instance types to use (defaults to `n1-highmem-4`).
* `GKE_LOCAL_SSD_COUNT`: Sets the number of locally attached SSD disks attached to each GCP instance (defaults to `1`). Each disk is 375GB.
* `GKE_NODE_COUNT_PER_ZONE`: Sets the amount of nodes per GCP zone (defaults to `1`). By default the GKE cluster is spun accross 3 zones.

### Using snapshot repositories

* Restrictions:
    * Currently only gcs is supported
    * We currently update the keystore only on pod initialisation, so adding or removing of repositories requires pod deletion/recreation at the moment until we have a sidecar to do this
* Either create a new bucket/service account or reuse our dev bucket (see Keybase)
* Create a secret with your [service account bucket credentials](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/master/repository-gcs-usage.html#repository-gcs-using-service-account)

     `kubectl create secret generic gcs-repo-account --from-file service-account.json`

* Specify in your stack resource that you want to use a repository like so:

    ```
     snapshotRepository:
      type: "gcs"
      settings:
        bucketName: "stack-sample-snapshot-repo"
        credentials:
          namespace: "default"
          name: "gcs-repo-account"
    ```
