// For each Elasticsearch cluster, we manage these CAs:
//   - Transport: Used to issue an unique certificate to every node, used for internal node-to-node communication
//     (Elasticsearch transport protocol).
//   - HTTP: Used to issue a single certificate (signed by the CA) that is shared between the Elasticsearch nodes if
//     no user provided certificate exists.
