# Overridable names of the Elasticsearch resource.
# By default, this is the Release name set for the chart,
# followed by 'eck-elasticsearch'.

# nameOverride will override the name of the Chart with the name set here,
# so nameOverride: quickstart, would convert to '{{ Release.name }}-quickstart'
#
# nameOverride: "quickstart"
#
# fullnameOverride will override both the release name, and the chart name,
# and will name the Elasticsearch resource exactly as specified.
