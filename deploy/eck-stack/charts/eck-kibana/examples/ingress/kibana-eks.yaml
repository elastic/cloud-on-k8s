    # To use an ALB with ECK, you must provide a valid ACM certificate ARN or use certificate discovery.
    # There are 2 options for EKS:
    # 1. Create a valid ACM certificate, and uncomment the following annotation and update it to the correct ARN.
    # 2. Create a valid ACM certificate and ensure that the hosts[0].host matches the certificate's Common Name (CN) and
    #    certificate discovery *should* find the certificate automatically and use it.
