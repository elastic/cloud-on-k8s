# Overridable names of the Kibana resource.
# By default, this is the Release name set for the chart,

# nameOverride will override the name of the Chart with the name set here,
# so nameOverride: quickstart, would convert to '{{ Release.name }}-quickstart'

# nameOverride: "quickstart"
#
# fullnameOverride will override both the release name, and the chart name,

# ** Deprecation Notice **
# The previous versions of this Helm Chart simply used the `spec` field here
# and allowed the user to specify any fields below spec that were templated directly
# into the final Kibana manifest. This is no long the preferred way to specify these
# fields and each field that is supported underneath `spec` is now directly specified
# in this values file. Currently both patterns are supported for backwards compatibility
# but we plan to remove the `spec` field in the future.

# Settings for controlling Kibana ingress. Enabling ingress will expose your Kibana instance
# to the public internet, and as such is disabled by default.
#
# *NOTE* when configuring Kibana Ingress, ensure that `config.server.publicBaseUrl` setting for
# Kibana is also set, as it is required when exposing Kibana behind a load balancer/ingress.
# Also of note are `server.basePath`, and `server.rewriteBasePath` settings in the Kibana configuration.

# Each Cloud Service Provider has different requirements for setting up Ingress. Some links to common documentation are:
# - AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html
# - GCP: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress
# - Azure: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing
# - Nginx: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/

  # Annotations that will be applied to the Ingress resource. Note that some ingress controllers are controlled via annotations.
  #
  # Nginx Annotations: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/
  #
  # Common annotations:
  #   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce          # Configures the Ingress resource to use the GCE ingress controller and create an external Application Load Balancer.
  #   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce-internal # Configures the Ingress resource to use the GCE ingress controller and create an internal Application Load Balancer.
  #   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx        # Configures the Ingress resource to use the NGINX ingress controller.

  # Some ingress controllers require the use of a specific class name to route traffic to the correct controller, notably AKS and EKS, which

  # Ingress paths are required to have a corresponding path type. Defaults to 'Prefix'.
  #
  # There are 3 supported path types:
  # - ImplementationSpecific
  # - Prefix
  # - Exact

  # ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types
  #
  pathType: Prefix

  # Hosts are a list of hosts included in the Ingress definition, with a corresponding path at which the Kibana service
  # will be exposed. Each host in the list should be a fully qualified DNS name that will resolve to the exposed Ingress object.

  # TLS defines whether TLS will be enabled on the Ingress resource.
  #
  # *NOTE* Many Cloud Service Providers handle TLS in a custom manner, and as such, it is recommended to consult their documentation.
  # Notably GKE and Nginx Ingress Controllers seems to respect the Ingress TLS settings, AKS and EKS ignore it.
