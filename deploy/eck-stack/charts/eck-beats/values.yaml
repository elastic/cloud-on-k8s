# Overridable names of the Beats resource.
# By default, this is the Release name set for the chart,

# nameOverride will override the name of the Chart with the name set here,
# so nameOverride: quickstart, would convert to '{{ Release.name }}-quickstart'
#
# nameOverride: "quickstart"
#
# fullnameOverride will override both the release name, and the chart name,

# ** Deprecation Notice **
# The previous versions of this Helm Chart simply used the `spec` field here
# and allowed the user to specify any fields below spec that were templated directly
# into the final Beats manifest. This is no longer the preferred way to specify these
# fields and each field that is supported underneath `spec` is now directly specified
# in this values file. Currently both patterns are supported for backwards compatibility
# but we plan to remove the `spec` field in the future.
